Integrity

en edition's differences with the vi version: 


1. 
Naive respondents really believe this pretense and behave accordingly, reporting some of their past deviance and their thoughts about the deviance of others, fearing that if they do not answer truthfully their untrue answers will reveal their "low integrity". 

2. 
Integrity can be seen as the state or condition of having such a framework, and acting congruently within the given framework. 

3. 
[...] We assert that integrity (the condition of being whole and complete) is a necessary condition for workability, and that the resultant level of workability determines the available opportunity for performance. 

4. 
To discover and apply these principles, courts interpret the legal data (legislation, cases etc.) with a view to articulating an interpretation that best explains and justifies past legal practice. 

5. 

An individual [[value system]] provides a [[Conceptual framework|framework]] within which the individual acts in ways which are consistent and expected. 

6. 
[[Aristotle]] identified pride (''megalopsuchia'', variously translated as proper pride, greatness of soul and magnanimity)<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iBoqmEvavawC&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=megalopsuchia+magnanimity+and+pride |title=The Nicomachean Ethics By Aristotle, James Alexander, Kerr Thomson, Hugh Tredennick, Jonathan Barnes translators |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2012-03-11|isbn=9780140449495 |year=1976 }}</ref> as the crown of the virtues, distinguishing it from vanity, temperance, and humility. 

7. 

Ethical integrity is not synonymous with the good, as Zuckert and Zuckert show about [[Ted Bundy]]:

{{quote|When caught, he defended his actions in terms of the [[fact-value distinction]]. 

8. 
 Corrupted information is [[Trust (social sciences)|untrustworthy]], yet uncorrupted information is of value. 

9. 
There is, however, a risk that politicians will not use this power to serve society.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Aristotle said that because rulers have power they will be tempted to use it for personal gain.<ref>Aristotle (2000), ''Politics'', translated by B. 

10. 
Dworkin rejects Hart's conception of a master rule in every legal system that identifies valid laws, on the basis that this would [[logical consequence|entail]] that the process of identifying law must be uncontroversial, whereas (Dworkin argues) people have legal rights even in cases where the correct legal outcome is open to reasonable dispute. 

11. 
Questions about a person’s integrity cast doubt not only on their intentions but also on the source of those intentions, the person’s character. 

12. 

==In the philosophy of law==
Dworkin argues that moral principles that people hold dear are often wrong, even to the extent that certain crimes are acceptable if one's principles are skewed enough. 

13. 
U weet langzammerhand dat geen enkele test zo'n claim waar kan maken, zelfs niet een die gespecialiseerd is in het opsporen van bedriegers.” Translated: “TIP: This sort of questions lists mention in cool blood that they are able to detect when you give a cheating answer or try to deceive the test. 

14. 

== In ethics ==
In [[ethics]] when discussing [[behavior]] and [[morality]], an individual is said to possess the virtue of integrity if the individual's actions are based upon an internally consistent framework of principles.<ref name="MacCallum1993">{{cite book|author=Gerald Cushing MacCallum|title=Legislative Intent and Other Essays on Law, Politics, and Morality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3yLFD_FgdIC|accessdate=12 July 2014|year=1993|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-13860-8|page=152}}</ref><ref name="Pillai2011">{{cite book|author=Krishna Pillai|title=Essence of a Manager|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUU64EsXeHEC|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=26 February 2011|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-17581-7|page=163}}</ref> These principles should uniformly adhere to sound logical [[axiom]]s or postulates. 

15. 

Out of the idea that law is 'interpretive' in this way, Dworkin argues that in every situation where people's legal rights are controversial, the best interpretation involves the right answer thesis, the thesis that there exists a right answer as a matter of law that the judge must discover. 

16. 

One essential aspect of a consistent framework is its avoidance of any unwarranted (arbitrary) exceptions for a particular person or group—especially the person or group that holds the framework. 

17. 
Dworkin moves away from [[legal positivism|positivism's]] separation of law and morality, since constructive interpretation implicates moral judgments in every decision about what the law is. 

18. 
An individual must therefore be flexible and willing to adjust these values to maintain consistency when these values are challenged—such as when an expected test result is not congruent with all observed outcomes.
