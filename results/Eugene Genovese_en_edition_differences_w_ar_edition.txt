1. 
Genovese's Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made, and Other Works" in Allen Weinstein and Frank Gatell, eds., ''American Negro Slavery'' (Oxford UP, 1979), 257-271,</ref>

In his 1979 book ''From Rebellion to Revolution'', Genovese depicted a change in slave rebellions from attempts to win freedom to an effort to overthrow slavery as a social system. 

2. 
The Radical Caucus, he said, were a bunch of "totalitarians." Genovese ended his speech by saying that the time had come for historians to isolate and defeat the New Left and "put them down, put them down hard, once and for all."<ref>{{cite book |last=Duberman |first=Martin |author-link=Martin Duberman |year=2012 |title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jmRhkcsUyQIC&printsec=frontcover |publisher=[[The New Press]] |pages=365 |isbn=9781595586780}}</ref> When the vote was finally taken, the resolution lost, 647 to 611. 

3. 
In 1968, Genovese signed the “[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.<ref>{{cite news |title=Writers and Editors War Tax Protest |date=January 30, 1968 |newspaper=[[The New York Post]] |last=Walker |first=Gerald |author-link=Gerald Walker}}</ref>

At the 1969 convention of the American Historical Association, radical historians [[Staughton Lynd]] and [[Arthur Waskow]], speaking on behalf of the Radical Caucus, introduced and later withdrew a resolution demanding an end to not only to the war in Vietnam but also the repression of the Black Panther party. 

4. 

During the discussion on the resolution, Genovese gave a speech, saying that although he opposed the Vietnam war, if the radicals' resolution passed, the bulk of historians in the AHA, who favored the war, would be forced to resign from the group. 

5. 
Genovese paid close attention to the role of religion as a form of resistance in the daily life of the slaves, because slaves used it to claim a sense of humanity. 

6. 
He redefined resistance to slavery as all efforts by which slaves rejected their status as slaves, including their religion, music, and the culture they built, as well as work slowdowns, periodic disappearances, and escapes and open rebellions.<ref>

7. 
Noting that the majority of Americans also supported the war, Genovese said that those citizens were as moral and deserving of being heard as the war’s opponents. 

8. 
 Areas of criticism included Genovese's placing of the master-slave relationship at the center of his interpretation of the American South, his views on southern [[white guilt]] over slavery, his employment of Gramsci's construct of [[hegemony]], and his interpretations of southern white class interests, slave religion, the strength of the slave family, the existence of slave culture, and the theory of the generation of black nationalism in the antebellum years.<ref>Richard H.

A close analysis of works such as ''The Political Economy of Slavery'' shows his greatest lacunae: the minimizing of the significance of black struggle and the magnifying of whatever elements of passivity can be found among blacks insofar as they actively participated in the Civil War.

In the 1960s, Genovese in his Marxist stage depicted the masters of the slaves as part of a "seigneurial" society that was anti-modern, pre-bourgeois and pre-capitalist. 

25. 
For Genovese, the slaveholding society of the Old South was rooted in exploitative class relationships, but most important was the cultural hegemony of slaveholders, their paternalistic ideology establishing both the potential and limits for a semiautonomous slave culture of resistance."<ref>{{cite book |first=Dennis |last=Dworkin |title=Class Struggles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKZV_5Ea-QkC |location=Edinburgh |publisher=[[Pearson Education]] |year=2007 |pages=57–58 |isbn=9781405801386}}</ref>

Genovese placed paternalism at the center of the master-slave relationship.
