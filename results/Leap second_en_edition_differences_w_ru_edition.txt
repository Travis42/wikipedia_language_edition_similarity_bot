How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.

Arguments against the proposal include the unknown expense of such a major change and the fact that universal time will no longer correspond to mean solar time.

==Future of leap seconds==
The TAI and UT1 time scales are precisely defined, the former by atomic clocks (and thus independent of Earth's rotation) and the latter by astronomical observations (that measure actual planetary rotation and thus the solar time at the Greenwich meridian). 

34. 
It is also easy to convert GPS time to TAI, as TAI is always exactly 19 seconds ahead of GPS time.

On clocks that display local time tied to UTC, the leap second may be inserted at the end of some other hour (or half-hour or quarter-hour), depending on the local time zone.

However, the spacing is quite irregular and apparently increasing: there were no leap seconds in the six-year interval between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2004, but there were nine leap seconds in the eight years 1972–1979. 

41. 
During that period, therefore, the "seconds" of broadcast services were actually slightly longer than the SI second and closer to the GMT seconds. 

42. 
After 1972, both clocks have been ticking in SI seconds, so the difference between their displays at any time is 10 seconds plus the total number of leap seconds that have been applied to UTC (37 seconds {{as of|January 2019|lc=on}}).

Instead of inserting a leap second at the end of the day, [[Google]] servers implement a "leap smear", extending seconds slightly over a time window prior to the leap second.<ref name=google-smear>{{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/time-technology-and-leaping-seconds.html|title=Time, technology and leaping seconds|date=September 15, 2011|author=Christopher Pascoe|publisher=[[Google]]|accessdate=July 2, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702030514/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/time-technology-and-leaping-seconds.html|archivedate=July 2, 2012}}</ref>  Amazon followed a similar, but slightly different, pattern for the introduction of the June 30, 2015 leap second,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/look-before-you-leap-the-coming-leap-second-and-aws/|title=Look Before You Leap – The Coming Leap Second and AWS (Updated)|author1=Jeff Barr|date=May 18, 2015|publisher=[[Amazon Web Services]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519030939/https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/look-before-you-leap-the-coming-leap-second-and-aws/|archivedate=May 19, 2015}}</ref> leading to another case of the proliferation of timescales. 

44. 
The UTC time standard, which is widely used for international timekeeping and as the reference for [[civil time]] in most countries, uses precise "atomic time" and consequently would run ahead of observed solar time unless it is reset to UT1 as needed. 

45. 
Systems that cannot tolerate disruptions caused by leap seconds can base their time on TAI and use [[Precision Time Protocol]]. 

46. 

When the Coordinated Universal Time standard was instituted in 1961, based on atomic clocks, it was felt necessary to maintain agreement with the GMT time of day, which, until then, had been the reference for broadcast time services. 

47. 
Demetrios Matsakis, the [[United States Naval Observatory]]'s Chief Scientist for Time Services, presented the reasoning in favor of the redefinition and rebuttals to the arguments made against it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/papers/ts-2014/Matsakis-LeapSecondComments.URSI-2014.pdf |title=Comments on the Debate over the Proposal to Redefine UTC |author1=Demetrios Matsakis |date=August 18, 2014 |access-date=2017-10-31 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208050335/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/papers/ts-2014/Matsakis-LeapSecondComments.URSI-2014.pdf |archivedate=February 8, 2017  }}</ref> He stressed the practical inability of software programmers to allow for the fact that leap seconds make time appear to go backwards, particularly when most of them do not even know that leap seconds exist. 

48. 

In 1972, the leap-second system was introduced so that the UTC seconds could be set exactly equal to the standard SI second, while still maintaining the UTC time of day and changes of UTC date synchronized with those of UT1 (the solar time standard that superseded GMT).<ref name="USNO"/> By then, the UTC clock was already 10 seconds behind TAI, which had been synchronized with UT1 in 1958, but had been counting true SI seconds since then. 

49. 
It is also answered that two timescales that do not follow leap seconds are already available, [[International Atomic Time]] (<span title='Temps Atomique International' lang='fr'>TAI</span>) and [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) time. 

50. 
This left the receiver's time off by a second in the interim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guralp.com/howtos/leap-second-problem-with-older-gps-receivers.shtml|title=Leap-second problem with older GPS receivers|date=November 19, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129055128/http://www.guralp.com/howtos/leap-second-problem-with-older-gps-receivers.shtml|archivedate=November 29, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spirent.com/Blogs/Positioning/2015/May/How_Leap_Seconds_Can_Interfere_with_GNSS_Receivers|title=How Leap Seconds Can Interfere with GNSS Receivers|date=May 13, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306014132/http://www.spirent.com/Blogs/Positioning/2015/May/How_Leap_Seconds_Can_Interfere_with_GNSS_Receivers|archivedate=March 6, 2016}}</ref>

Older Datum Tymeserve 2100 GPS receivers and Symmetricom Tymeserve 2100 receivers also have a similar flaw to that of the older Trimble GPS receivers, with the time being off by one second.

==Issues created by insertion (or removal) of leap seconds==
====Calculation of time differences and sequence of events====
To compute the elapsed time in seconds between two given UTC dates requires the consultation of a table of leap seconds, which needs to be updated whenever a new leap second is announced.
