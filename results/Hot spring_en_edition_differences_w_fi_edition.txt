How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

[[Water]] issuing from a hot spring is heated [[geothermal (geology)|geothermally]], that is, with [[heat]] produced from the [[Earth]]'s [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]].

==Sources of heat==
Much of the heat is created by [[radioactive decay|decay]] of naturally radioactive elements. 

4. 
If the water is mixed with mud and [[clay]], it is called a [[mud pot]].

One example of a non-volcanic warm spring is [[Warm Springs, Georgia]] (frequented for its [[physical therapy|therapeutic]] effects by [[paraplegic]] [[President of the United States|U.S.

* The springs in Europe with the highest temperatures are located in France, in a small village named [[Chaudes-Aigues]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Located at the heart of the French volcanic region [[Auvergne]], the thirty natural hot springs of Chaudes-Aigues have temperatures ranging from 45&nbsp;°C (113&nbsp;°F) to more than 80&nbsp;°C (176&nbsp;°F).

A '''hot spring''' is a [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]] produced by the emergence of [[Geothermal (geology)|geothermally heated]] [[groundwater]] that rises from the [[Earth's crust]].

(2003) suggest that the phrase "warm spring" is not useful and should be avoided.<ref name="pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca"/> The US [[NOAA]] Geophysical Data Center defines a "warm spring" as a spring with water between {{convert|20|and|50|°C|°F}}. 

10. 

Warm springs are sometimes the result of hot and [[spring (hydrosphere)|cold springs]] mixing. 

11. 
There are many more high flow non-thermal springs than geothermal springs.
