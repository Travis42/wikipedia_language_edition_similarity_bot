How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

Historical linguistics

en edition's differences with the ar version: 


1. 
A formal language is often defined by means of a [[formal grammar]], but it does not describe their [[semantics]] (i.e., what they mean).</ref>

Words as units in the lexicon are the subject matter of [[lexicology]]. 

2. 
Often dating must rely on contextual historical evidence such as inscriptions, or, modern technology such as carbon dating can be used to ascertain dates of varying accuracy.

===Morphology===
[[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] is the study of the formal means of expression in a language; in the context of historical linguistics, how the formal means of expression change over time; for instance, languages with complex inflectional systems tend to be subject to a simplification process. 

5. 
 However, a diachronic analysis will show that the strong verb is the remnant of a fully regular system of internal vowel changes, in this case, namely, the [[Indo-European ablaut]]; historical linguistics seldom uses the category "[[irregular verb]]".

For example, a [[Germanic strong verb]] like English ''sing – sang – sung'' is [[regular verb|irregular]] when viewed synchronically: the native speaker's brain [[neurolinguistics|processes]] these as learned forms, whereas the derived forms of regular verbs are processed quite differently, by the application of productive rules (for example, adding ''-ed'' to the basic form of a verb as in ''walk – walked'').

In linguistics, a '''synchronic analysis''' is one that views linguistic phenomena only at a given time, usually the present, though a synchronic analysis of a historical language form is also possible. 

9. 
 Most research is being carried out on the subsequent development of these languages, in particular, the development of the modern standard varieties. 

10. 
We therefore must distinguish the cultural, or Lamarckian, evolution of language, a concern of historical linguistics, from its biological, or neo-Darwinian, evolution, a concern of developmental biology. 

11. 
Less-standard techniques, such as [[mass lexical comparison]], are used by some linguists to overcome the limitations of the comparative method, but most linguists regard them as unreliable. 

12. 
In some other languages like [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the same difference of aspiration or non-aspiration differentiates words and so the two sounds (or [[Phone (phonetics)|phones]]) are therefore considered two distinct phonemes. 

13. 
This field studies the internal structure of words as a formal means of expression.<ref>A ''formal language'' is a set of words, i.e. 

14. 
In English these two sounds are used in [[complementary distribution]] and are not used to differentiate words so they are considered [[allophones]] of the same [[phoneme]]. 

15. 
While words are generally accepted as being (with [[clitic]]s) the smallest units of [[syntax]], it is clear that, in most (if not all) languages, words can be related to other words by rules. 

16. 
The study of language change offers a valuable insight into the state of linguistic representation, and because all synchronic forms are the result of historically evolving diachronic changes, the ability to explain linguistic constructions necessitates a focus on diachronic processes.<ref>Bybee, Joan L. 

17. 
The time-depth of linguistic methods is limited due to chance word resemblances and variations between language groups, but a limit of around 10,000 years is often assumed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baldi|first=Philip|author-link=Philip Baldi|year=2012|title=Historical Linguistics and Cognitive Science|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/ped10/Giuli_Dussias/Publications/External/Baldi_Dussias_Rhesis_2012_GD_09_13_2012.pdf|journal=Rheis, International Journal of Linguistics, Philology and Literature|volume=3|issue=1|pages=5–27}} p.&nbsp;11.</ref> The dating of the various proto-languages is also difficult; several methods are available for dating, but only approximate results can be obtained. 

18. 
Primacy is accorded to synchronic linguistics, and '''diachronic linguistics''' is defined as the study of successive synchronic stages. 

19. 
 Diachronic analysis is the main concern of historical linguistics; however, most other branches of linguistics are concerned with some form of synchronic analysis.
