==Overview==
The historical period of [[ancient Greece]] is unique in world history as the first period attested directly in proper [[historiography]], while earlier ancient history or [[proto-history]] is known by much more circumstantial evidence, such as [[annal]]s, [[chronicle]]s, [[List of lists of ancient kings|king lists]], and pragmatic [[epigraphy]]
