4.00178e-11
 The [[continental crust]] has become enriched with those elements relative to the mantle and thus more He<sup>4</sup> is produced in the crust than in the mantle
5.09317e-11

All degassed helium is lost to space eventually, due to the average speed of helium exceeding the [[escape velocity]] for the Earth
8.73115e-11
Because their abundances are normally quoted as activity ratios rather than atomic ratios, they are best considered separately from the other radiogenic isotope systems
4.30191e-10

Common values for '''R/Ra''':
* Old continental crust: less than 1
* [[oceanic ridge|mid-ocean ridge]] [[basalt]] (MORB): 7 to 9
* Spreading ridge rocks: 9.1 plus or minus 3.6
* [[Hotspot (geology)|Hotspot]] rocks: 5 to 42
* Ocean and terrestrial water: 1
* Sedimentary formation water: less than 1
* Thermal spring water: 3 to 11

<sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He isotope chemistry is being used to date [[groundwater]]s, estimate groundwater flow rates, track water pollution, and provide insights into [[hydrothermal]] processes, [[igneous]] [[geology]] and [[ore genesis]]

Radiogenic isotope tracers are most powerful when used together with other tracers: The more tracers used, the more control on mixing processes
0.0492515
As a result, there is a relationship between <sup>231</sup>Pa/<sup>230</sup>Th in Atlantic sediments and the rate of overturning: faster overturning produces lower sediment <sup>231</sup>Pa/<sup>230</sup>Th ratio, while slower overturning increases this ratio
0.0507673

The difference in the ratio of the sample relative to CHUR can give information on a model age of extraction from the mantle (for which an assumed evolution has been calculated relative to CHUR) and to whether this was extracted from a granitic source (depleted in radiogenic Nd), the mantle, or an enriched source
0.058621
 The <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio is also an indicator of paleoclimate: a change in the ratio in the remains of plants indicates a change in the amount of photosynthetic activity, and thus in how favorable the environment was for the plants

Due to similarities in [[helium]] and [[carbon]] in [[magma]] chemistry, outgassing of helium requires the loss of [[Volatiles#Igneous petrology|volatile components]] ([[water]], [[carbon dioxide]]) from the mantle, which happens at depths of less than 60&nbsp;km

[[Nitrogen]] has two stable isotopes, <sup>14</sup>N and <sup>15</sup>N

During photosynthesis, organisms using the  [[C3 pathway|C<sub>3</sub> pathway]] show different enrichments compared to those using the  [[C4 pathway|C<sub>4</sub> pathway]], allowing scientists not only to distinguish organic matter from abiotic carbon, but also what type of photosynthetic pathway the organic matter was using.<ref name="drever_2002"/>  Occasional spikes in the global <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio have also been useful as stratigraphic markers for [[chemostratigraphy]], especially during the [[Paleozoic]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://u.osu.edu/saltzman.11/files/2014/05/P3_2002_SD-203uave.pdf|title = Carbon isotope (d13C) stratigraphy across the Silurian-Devonian transition in North America: evidence for a perturbation of the global carbon cycle|date = 2002|journal = Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|volume = 187|issue = 1–2|pages = 83–100|doi = 10.1016/s0031-0182(02)00510-2 |pmid = |access-date = 7 Jan 2017|bibcode = 2002PPP...187...83S|last1 = Saltzman|first1 = Matthew R}}</ref>

The [[radiocarbon|<sup>14</sup>C]] ratio has been used to track ocean circulation, among other things
0.156323
Because the lead isotopes are created by decay of different transuranic elements, the ratios of the four lead isotopes to one another can be very useful in tracking the source of melts in [[igneous rock]]s, the source of [[sediment]]s and even the origin of people via [[isotopic fingerprint]]ing of their teeth, skin and bones
