Much of his editorializing in ''Annales'' emphasised the importance of parallel evidence to be found in neighbouring fields of study, especially [[archaeology]], [[ethnography]], [[geography]], [[literature]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[technology]],{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=272}}  [[air photography]], [[ecology]], [[Pollen analyses|pollen analysis]] and [[statistics]].{{Sfn|Loyn|1999|pp=165–166}} In Bloch's view, this provided not just for a broader field of study, but a far more comprehensive understanding of the past than would be possible from relying solely on historical sources.{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=272}} Bloch's favourite example of how technology impacts society was the [[watermill]]

Epstein]], was the "professional, extensively researched and documented" story of Bloch's life, and, he commented, probably had to "overcome a strong sense of protectiveness among the guardians of Bloch's and the ''Annales{{'}}'' memory".{{Sfn|Epstein|1993|p=273}} Since then, continuing scholarship—such as that by Stirling, who calls Bloch a visionary, although a "flawed" one{{sfn|Stirling|2007|p=525}}—has been more critically objective of Bloch's recognisable weaknesses

While Bloch's Jewish roots were important to him, this was the result of the political tumult of the Dreyfuss years, said Loyn: that "it was only anti-semitism that made him want to affirm his Jewishness".{{Sfn|Loyn|1999|p=163}}

Bloch's chapter was "The Rise of Dependent Cultivation and Seignorial Institutions" in the first volume.{{sfn|Lyon|1987|p=204}}|group=note}} He later told Febvre in some ways he felt he had a closer affinity with academic life in England than that of France.{{Sfn|Fink|1998|pp=44–45}} For example, in comparing the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|''Bibliothèque Nationale'']] with the [[British Museum]], he said that{{Sfn|Weber|1991|p=249 n.<!--note number needed?--><!--Not possible I'm afraid; Weber doesn't over-indulge in footnotes and, when he uses them at all, they're just indicated by asterisks-->}}

This can be summed up as illustrating how it was known of but little used in the classical period; it became an economic necessity in the early medieval period; and finally, in the later Middle Ages it represented a scarce resource increasingly concentrated in the nobility's hands.{{Sfn|Hughes|2002|p=127}}{{Refn|*''More on watermill''*|group=note}}

Bloch also emphasised the importance of geography in the study of history, and particularly in the study of rural history.{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=274}} He suggested that, fundamentally, they were the same subjects, although he criticised geographers for failing to take historical chronology{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=275}} or [[human agency]] into account

As a result, the ''Annales'' often contained commentary on contemporary, rather than exclusively historical, events.{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=530}} Editing the journal led to Bloch forming close professional relationships with scholars in different fields across Europe.{{Sfn|Epstein|1993|p=274}} The ''Annales'' was the only academic journal to boast a preconceived methodological perspective

In 1934, [[Étienne Gilson]] sponsored Bloch's candidacy for a chair at the Collège de France.{{Sfn|Raftis|1999|p=63}} The College, says the historian [[Eugen Weber]], was Bloch's "dream" appointment, although one never to be realised, as it was one of the few (possibly the only) institutions in France where personal research was central to lecturing.{{Sfn|Weber|1991|p=254}} [[Camille Jullian]] had died the previous year, and his position was now available

At the turn of the millennium "there is a woeful lack of critical engagement with Marc Bloch's writing in contemporary academic circles" according to Stirling.{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=526}} His legacy has been further complicated by the fact that the second generation of Annalists led by [[Fernand Braudel]] has "co-opted his memory",{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=526}}{{Refn|They did not do this with the intention of suppressing discussion of Bloch's ideas, wrote Karen Stirling, but "it is easy for contemporary scholars to confuse Bloch's own individualistic work as a historian with that of his structuralist successors"

Bloch's most important early work—based on his doctoral dissertation—was published in 1924 as ''Rois et Thaumaturges''; it was published in English as ''The Royal Touch: Monarchy and Miracles in France and England'' in 1973.{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=529}} Here he examined medieval belief in the [[royal touch]], and the degree to which kings used such a belief for propaganda purposes.{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=276}} It was also the first example of Bloch's inter-disciplinary approach, as he utilised research from the fields of anthropology, medicine, psychology{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=529}} and [[iconography]].{{Sfn|Hughes-Warrington|2015|p=13}} It has been described as Bloch's first masterwork.{{Sfn|Fink|1995|p=209}} It has a 500-page descriptive analysis of the medieval view of royalty effectively possessing  supernatural powers

In other, newer departments such a sociology, efforts were made at establishing an independent identity.{{Sfn|Friedman|1996|p=3}}  Bloch graduated in 1908 with degrees in both geography and history (Davies notes, given Bloch's later divergent interests, the significance of the two qualifications).{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=267}} He had a high respect for [[historical geography]], then a speciality of French historiography,{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=275}} as practiced by his tutor [[Vidal de la Blache]] whose ''Tableau de la géographie'' Bloch had studied at the ÉNS,{{Sfn|Baulig|1945|p=5}} and [[Lucien Gallois]].{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=275}} Bloch applied unsuccessfully for a fellowship at the ''[[Fondation Dosne-Thiers|Fondation Thiers]]''.{{Sfn|Fink|1991|p=40}} As a result,{{Sfn|Fink|1991|p=40}} he travelled to Germany in 1909{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=267}} where he studied [[demography]] under [[Karl Bücher]] in [[Leipzig]] and [[Religious studies|religion]]{{Sfn|Lyon|1987|p=198}} under [[Adolf von Harnack|Adolf Harnack]] in [[Berlin]];{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=267}} he did not, however, particularly socialise with fellow students while in Germany.{{Sfn|Schöttler|2010|p=415}} He returned to France the following year and again applied to the ''Fondation'', this time successfully.{{Sfn|Fink|1991|p=40}} Bloch researched the medieval [[Île-de-France]]{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=267}} in preparation for his thesis.{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|p=184}} This research was Bloch's first focus on rural history.{{Sfn|Hughes|2002|p=127}} His parents had moved house and now resided at the [[Avenue d'Orleans]], not far from Bloch's quarters.{{Sfn|Fink|1991|p=43}}{{Refn|This road is now the ''Avenue de Maréchal Leclerc''.{{sfn|Weber|1991|p=245}}|group=note}}

Bloch was a committed supporter of the Third Republic and politically left wing.{{Sfn|Schöttler|2010|p=415}} He was not a [[Marxism|Marxist]], although he was impressed by [[Karl Marx]] himself, whom he thought was a great historian if possibly "an unbearable man" personally.{{Sfn|Friedman|1996|p=11}} He viewed contemporary politics as purely moral decisions to be made.{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=282}} He did not, however, let it enter into his work; indeed, he questioned the very idea of a historian studying politics.{{Sfn|Dosse|1994|p=44}} He believed that society should be governed by the young, and, although politically he was a moderate, he noted that revolutions generally promote the young over the old: "even the Nazis had done this, while the French had done the reverse, bringing to power a generation of the past".{{Sfn|Chirot|1984|p=43}} According to Epstein, following the First World War, Bloch presented a "curious lack of empathy and comprehension for the horrors of modern warfare",{{Sfn|Epstein|1993|p=276}} while [[John Lewis Gaddis]] has found Bloch's failure to condemn [[Stalinism]] in the 1930s "disturbing".{{Sfn|Gaddis|2002|p=128}} Gaddis suggests that Bloch had ample evidence of Stalin's crimes and yet sought to shroud them in utilitarian calculations about the price of what he called 'progress'".{{Sfn|Gaddis|2002|p=128}}

Although Bloch was very reserved{{Sfn|Friedman|1996|p=10}}—and later acknowledged that he had generally been old-fashioned and "timid" with women{{Sfn|Fink|1998|p=43}}—he was good friends with Lucien Febvre and Christian Pfister.{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=267}} In July 1919 he married Simonne Vidal, a "cultivated and discreet, timid and energetic"{{Sfn|Friedman|1996|p=12}} woman, at a [[Jewish wedding]].{{Sfn|Epstein|1993|p=276}} Her father was the [[Ponts et chaussées|''Inspecteur-Général de Ponts et Chaussées'']], and a very prosperous and influential man

''La Société Féodale'' was published in two volumes (''The Growth of Ties of Dependence'', and ''Social Classes and Political Organisation'') in 1939, and was translated into English as [[Feudal Society (Marc Bloch)|''Feudal Society'']] in 1961.{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=265}} Bloch described the study as something of a sketch,{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=269}} although Stirling has called it his "most enduring work ..

He believed that using the method in historical research could prevent the historian from ignoring the broader context in the course of his detailed local researches:{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=279}} "a simple application of the comparative method exploded the ethnic theories of historical institutions, beloved of so many German historians".{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=280}}

The Annalist historian [[André Burguière]] suggests Febvre did not really understand the position Bloch, or any French Jew, was in.{{Sfn|Burguière|2009|p=45}} Already damaged by this disagreement, Bloch's and Febvre's relationship declined further when the former had been forced to leave his library and papers{{Sfn|Fink|1995|p=208}} in his Paris apartment following his move to Vichy

According to Stirling, he managed to achieve "an imperfect and volatile imbalance" between them.{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=528}} Bloch did not believe that it was possible to understand or recreate the past by the mere act of compiling facts from sources; rather, he described a source as a witness, "and like most witnesses", he wrote, "it rarely speaks until one begins to question it".{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=274}} Likewise, he viewed historians as detectives who gathered evidence and testimony, as [[Juge d'instruction|''juges d'instruction'']] (examining magistrates) "charged with a vast enquiry of the past".{{Sfn|Weber|1991|p=250}}

[[Intellectual history|Intellectual historian]] [[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]] named Bloch the leader of what he called the "French Historical Revolution",{{Sfn|Burke|1990|p=7}} and Bloch became an icon for the post-war generation of new historians.{{Sfn|Sreedharan|2004|p=259}} Although he has been described as being, to some extent, the object of a [[cult]] in both England and France{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=265}}—"one of the most influential historians of the twentieth century"{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=525}} by Stirling, and "the greatest historian of modern times" by [[John H

Bloch emphasises failures in the French mindset: in the loss of morale of the soldiery and a failed education of the officers,{{Sfn|Loyn|1999|p=172}} effectively a failure of both character and intelligence on behalf of both.{{Sfn|Weber|1991|p=253}} He condemns the "mania" for [[Test (education)|testing]] in education which, he felt, treated the testing as being an end in itself, draining  generations of Frenchmen and Frenchwomen of originality and initiative or thirst for knowledge, and an "appreciation only of successful cheating and sheer luck".{{Sfn|Weber|1991|p=253}} ''Strange Defeat'' has been called Bloch's autopsy of the France of the inter-war years.{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|p=184}}

A collection of essays was published in English in 1961 as ''Land and Work in Medieval Europe''.{{Sfn|Loyn|1999|p=166}} The long essay was a favoured medium of Bloch's, including, Davies says, "the famous essay on the water mill and the much-challenged one on the problem of gold in medieval Europe".{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=266}} In the former, Bloch saw one of the most important technological advances of the era, in the latter, the effective creation of a European currency.{{Sfn|Loyn|1999|p=172}}{{Refn|Specifically, Bloch wanted to know why Genoa and Florence were the first European nations to issue gold coinage

Febvre was some years older than Bloch and was probably a great influence on him.{{Sfn|Lyon|1987|p=201}} They lived in the same area of Strasbourg{{Sfn|Friedman|1996|p=10}} and became kindred spirits,{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|p=182}} often going on walking trips across the [[Vosges]] and other excursions.{{Sfn|Hughes|2002|p=127}}

Bloch's fundamental views on the nature and purpose of the study of history were established by 1920.{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=270}} That same year he defended,{{Sfn|Friedman|1996|p=4}} and subsequently published, his thesis.{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=267}} It was not as extensive a work as had been intended due to the war.{{Sfn|Fink|1995|p=209}} There was a provision in French [[further education]] for doctoral candidates for whom the war had interrupted their research to submit only a small portion of the full-length thesis usually required.{{Sfn|Hughes|2002|p=127}} It sufficed, however, to demonstrate his credentials as a medievalist in the eyes of his contemporaries.{{Sfn|Hughes|2002|p=127}} He began publishing articles in [[Henri Berr|Henri Berr's]] [[Revue de synthèse|''Revue de Synthèse Historique'']].{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|pp=181–182}} Bloch also published his first major work, ''[[Les Rois Thaumaturges]]'', which he later described as "''ce gros enfant''" (this big child).{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=265}} In 1928, Bloch was invited to lecture at the Institute for the Comparative Study of Civilizations in Oslo

Undoubtedly, says Friedman, his wife's family wealth allowed Bloch to focus on his research without having to depend on the income he made from it.{{Sfn|Friedman|1996|p=11}} Bloch was later to say he had found great happiness with her, and that he believed her to have also found it with him.{{Sfn|Fink|1998|p=43}} They had six children together,{{Sfn|Fink|1998|p=40}} four sons and two daughters.{{Sfn|Loyn|1999|p=163}} The eldest two were a daughter Alice,{{Sfn|Fink|1998|p=42}}{{Sfn|Epstein|1993|p=274}} and a son, Étienne.{{Sfn|Epstein|1993|p=274}} As his father had done with him, Bloch took a great interest in his children's education, and regularly helped with their [[homework]].{{Sfn|Friedman|1996|p=12}} He could, though, be "caustically critical"{{Sfn|Fink|1998|p=42}} of his children, particularly Étienne

The Nazis wanted French [[editorial board]]s to be stripped of Jews in accordance with German [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial policies]]; Bloch advocated disobedience, while Febvre was passionate about the survival of ''Annales'' at any cost.{{Sfn|Dosse|1994|p=43}} He believed that it was worth making concessions to keep the journal afloat and to keep France's intellectual life alive.{{Sfn|Burguière|2009|p=43}} Bloch rejected out of hand any suggestion that he should, in his words, "fall into line".{{Sfn|Burguière|2009|p=44}} Febvre also asked Bloch to resign as joint-editor of the journal

While on front-line service, Bloch contracted severe [[arthritis]] which required him to retire regularly to the [[thermal bath]]s of [[Aix-les-Bains]] for treatment.{{Sfn|Fink|1998|p=40}} He later remembered very little of the historical events he found himself in, writing only that his memories were{{Sfn|Bloch|1980|p=14}}{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=528}} "a discontinuous series of images, vivid in themselves, but badly arranged, like a reel of motion picture film containing some large gaps and some reversals of certain scenes".{{sfn|Bloch|1980|p=14}} Bloch later described the war, in a detached style, as having been a "gigantic social experience, of unbelievable richness".{{Sfn|Epstein|1993|pp=276–277}} For example, he had a habit of noting the different coloured smoke that different shells made — [[Shell (projectile)#Percussion fuze|percussion bombs]] had black smoke, [[Artillery fuze#Time fuzes|timed bombs]] were brown.{{Sfn|Weber|1991|p=245}} He also remembered both the "friends killed at our side ..

In the meantime, the allies had [[Invasion of Normandy|invaded Normandy]] on 6 June 1944.{{Sfn|Fink|1995|p=209}} As a result, the Nazi regime was keen to evacuate and wanted to "liquidate their holdings"{{Sfn|Weber|1991|p=244}} in France; this meant disposing of as many prisoners as they could.{{Sfn|Fink|1995|p=209}} Between May and June 1944 around 700 prisoners were shot in scattered locations to avoid the risk of this becoming common knowledge and inviting Resistance reprisals around southern France.{{Sfn|Fink|1995|p=209}} Among those killed was Bloch,{{Sfn|Dosse|1994|p=44}} one of a group of 26 Resistance prisoners{{Sfn|Fink|1995|p=209}}{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=531}} picked out in Montluc{{Sfn|Burguière|2009|p=39}} and driven along the [[Saône]] towards [[Trévoux]]{{Refn|Today this road is the [[route nationale|route nationale 433]].{{sfn|Weber|1991|p=244}}|group=note}} on the night of{{Sfn|Fink|1995|p=209}} 16 June 1944.{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=531}} Driven to a field near [[Saint-Didier-de-Formans]],{{Sfn|Fink|1995|p=209}} they were shot by the Gestapo in groups of four.{{Sfn|Weber|1991|p=244}} According to Lyon, Bloch spent his last moments comforting a 16-year-old beside him who was worried that the bullets might hurt.{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|p=186}} Bloch fell first, reputedly shouting "''Vive la France''"{{Sfn|Dosse|1994|p=44}} before being shot

Davies says this was particularly useful in Bloch's study of village communities as "the strength of communal traditions often preserves earlier customs in a more or less fossilized state".{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=271}} Bloch studied peasant tools in museums, and in action, and discussed their use with the people themselves.{{Sfn|Baulig|1945|p=7}} He believed that in observing a plough or an annual harvest one was observing history, as more often than not both the technology and the technique were much the same as they had been hundreds of years earlier.{{Sfn|Hughes|2002|p=127}} However, the individuals themselves were not his focus, which was on "the collectivity, the community, the society".{{Sfn|Davies|1967|pp=277–278}} He wrote about the peasantry, rather than the individual peasant; says Lyon, "he  roamed the provinces to become familiar with French agriculture over the long term, with the contours of peasant villages, with agrarian routine, its sounds and smells.{{Sfn|Lyon|1987|p=199}} Bloch claimed that both fighting alongside the peasantry in the war and his historical research into their history had shown him "the vigorous and unwearied quickness"{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|p=184}} of their minds.{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|p=184}}

Bloch described his area of study as the comparative history of European society and explained why he did not identify himself as a medievalist: "I refuse to do so

During the decade it published it maintained a staunchly left-wing position.{{Sfn|Huppert|1982|p=512}} [[Henri Pirenne]], a Belgian historian who wrote [[comparative history]], closely supported the new journal.{{Sfn|Lyon|1987|p=202}} Before the war he had acted in an unofficial capacity as a conduit between French and German schools of historiography.{{Sfn|Fink|1991|p=31}} [[Fernand Braudel]]—who was himself  to become an important member of the Annales School after World War Two—later described the journal's  management as being a chief executive officer—Bloch—with a minister of foreign affairs—Febvre.{{Sfn|Dosse|1994|p=107}}

The comparative method allowed Bloch to discover instances of uniqueness within aspects of society,{{Sfn|Sewell|1967|p=210}} and he advocated it as a new kind of history.{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|p=182}} According to Bryce Lyon, Braudel and Febvre, "promising to perform all the burdensome tasks" themselves, asked Pirenne to become [[editor-in-chief]] of ''Annales'' to no avail

A founding member of the [[Annales School]] of French social history, he specialised in [[medieval history]] and published widely on [[Medieval France]] over the course of his career
0.0850517
As Bloch saw it, it was his duty to correct that tendency.{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=280}} Both Bloch and Febvre were keen to refocus French historical scholarship on social rather than [[political history]] and to promote the use of sociological techniques.{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=530}} The journal avoided [[narrative history]] almost completely.{{Sfn|Fink|1995|p=207}}

The inaugural issue of the ''Annales'' stated the editors' basic aims: to counteract the arbitrary and artificial division of history into periods, to re-unite history and social science as a single body of thought, and to promote the acceptance of all other schools of thought into historiography
0.0860663
Bloch accused him in one of his wartime letters of having poor manners, being lazy and stubborn, and of being possessed occasionally by "evil demons".{{Sfn|Fink|1998|p=42}} Regarding the facts of life, Bloch told Etienne to attempt always to avoid what Bloch termed "contaminated females".{{Sfn|Fink|1998|p=42}}

Bloch was certainly [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], if not [[Atheism|atheist]], in matters of religion.{{Sfn|Epstein|1993|p=276}} His son Étienne later said of his father, "in his life as well as his writings not even the slightest trace of a supposed Jewish identity" can be found

His historical studies and his death as a member of the Resistance together made Bloch highly regarded by generations of post-war French historians; he came to be called "the greatest historian of all-time".{{Sfn|Weber|1991|p=244}} By the end of the 20th century, historians were making a more sober assessment of Bloch's abilities, influence, and legacy, arguing that there were flaws to his approach
0.0962251
Bloch, though, does not seem to have acknowledged the similarities between his and Lefebvre's approaches to physical research, even though he cited much earlier historians.{{Sfn|Chirot|1984|p=31}} Davies argued that there was a [[sociological]] aspect to Bloch's work which often neutralised the precision of his historical writing;{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=269}} as a result, he says, those of Bloch's works with a sociological conception, such as ''Feudal Society'', have not always "stood the test of time".{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=279}}

Comparative history, too, still proved controversial many years after Bloch's death,{{Sfn|Geremek|1986|p=1102}} and Bryce Lyon has posited that, had Bloch survived the war, it is very likely that his views on history—already changing in the early years of the second war, just as they had done in the aftermath of the first—would have re-adjusted themselves against the very school he had founded.{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|p=183}} Stirling suggests what distinguished Bloch from his predecessors was that he effectively became a new kind of historian, who "strove primarily for transparency of methodology where his predecessors had striven for transparency of data"{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=529}} while continuously critiquing himself at the same time.{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=529}} Davies suggests his legacy lies not so much in the body of work he left behind him, which is not always as definitive as it has been made out to be, but the influence he had on "a whole generation of French historical scholarship".{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=269}} Bloch's emphasis on how rural and village society has been neglected by historians in favour of the lords and manorial courts that ruled them influenced later historians such as [[R

The two were close, although Bloch later described Louis as being occasionally somewhat intimidating.{{Sfn|Friedman|1996|p=7}} The Bloch family lived at 72, [[Rue d'Alésia]], in the [[14th arrondissement of Paris]]

By the end of the year, and with further retirements, the College had lost four professors: it could replace only one, and Bloch was not appointed.{{Sfn|Weber|1991|p=255}} Bloch personally suspected his failure was due to anti-Semitism and [[Jewish quota]]s

Bloch interpreted Febvre's comment as implying that Bloch was not a victim

It is possible Bloch had been [[Denunciation|denounced]] by a woman working in the shop.{{Sfn|Weber|1991|p=244}} In any case, they found a radio transmitter and many papers.{{Sfn|Weber|1991|p=244}} Bloch was imprisoned in [[Montluc prison]],{{Sfn|Dosse|1994|p=44}} during which time his wife died.{{Sfn|Loyn|1999|p=163}} He was tortured with, for example, ice-cold baths which knocked him out

In the latter type of period, which changed gradually, Bloch included physical, structural and psychological aspects of society, while the generational era could experience fundamental change over a relatively few generations.{{Sfn|Chirot|1984|p=24}} Bloch founded what modern French historians call the "regressive method" of historical scholarship
0.0962251
But, says [[Peter Schöttler]], Bloch "had already coined this aphorism during the First World War and given it a
significant heading: 'On the history of France and why I am not a conservative'".{{sfn|Bloch|1980|p=165}}|group=note}} In 1977, Bloch received a [[State burial|state reburial]]; streets schools and universities have been named after him,{{Sfn|Hughes-Warrington|2015|p=16}} and the [[centennial]] of Bloch's birth was celebrated at a conference held in Paris in June 1986

By definition, all history was social history,{{Sfn|Geremek|1986|p=1102}} an approach he and Febvre termed ''"histoire totale"'',{{Sfn|Lyon|1987|p=200}} not a focus on points of fact such as dates of battles, reigns, and changes of leaders and ministries, and a general confinement by the historian to what he can identify and verify.{{Sfn|Rhodes|1999|p=110}} Bloch explained in a letter to Pirenne that, in Bloch's eyes, the historian's most important quality was the ability to be surprised by what he found—"I am more and more convinced of this", he said; "damn those of us who believe everything is normal!"{{Sfn|Watelet|2004|p=227}}{{Quote box

In France it was only to be expected: no one else was better qualified".{{Sfn|Hughes|2002|p=127}} His first lecture was on the theme of never-ending history, a process, a never to be finished thing.{{Sfn|Weber|1991|p=250}} Davies says his years at the Sorbonne were to be "the most fruitful" of Bloch's career,{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=267}} and according to Epstein he was by now the most significant French historian of his age.{{Sfn|Epstein|1993|p=274}} In 1936, Friedman says he considered using Marx in his teachings, with the intention of bringing "some fresh air" into the Sorbonne.{{Sfn|Friedman|1996|p=11}}

The same year, Bloch and his family visited [[Venice]], where they were [[Chaperone (social)|chaperoned]] by the Italian historian [[Gino Luzzatto]].{{Sfn|Epstein|1993|pp=274–275}}{{refn|There was a strong mutual respect between Luzzatto and Bloch and Febvre, who regularly reviewed his work in the ''Annales'', and for which he had most recently written an article in 1937.{{sfn|Lanaro|2006}}|group=note}} During this period they were living in the [[Sèvres – Babylone (Paris Métro)|Sèvres – Babylone]] area of Paris, next to the [[Hôtel Lutetia]].{{Sfn|Weber|1991|p=249}}

By now, ''Annales'' was being published six times a year to keep on top of current affairs, however, its "outlook was gloomy".{{Sfn|Huppert|1982|p=512}} In 1938, the publishers withdrew support and, experiencing financial hardship, the journal moved to cheaper offices, raised its prices and returned to publishing quarterly.{{Sfn|Huppert|1982|p=514}} Febvre increasingly opposed the direction Bloch wanted to take the journal

Hilton]] in the study of the economics of peasant society.{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=271}} Bloch's combination of economics, history and sociology was "forty years before it became fashionable", argues Daniel Chirot, which he says could make Bloch a founding father of post-war sociology scholarship.{{Sfn|Chirot|1984|p=22}}

The English-language journal [[Past & Present (journal)|''Past & Present'']], published by [[Oxford University Press]], was a direct successor to the ''Annales'', suggests Loyn.{{Sfn|Loyn|1999|p=166}} [[Michel Foucault]] said of the Annales School, "what Bloch, Febvre and Braudel have shown for history, we can show, I believe, for the history of ideas".{{Sfn|Dosse|1997|p=237}} Bloch's influence spread beyond historiography after his death

Bloch considered it and came close to accepting; ultimately, though, it was too far from his family,{{Sfn|Fink|1998|p=50}} whom he rarely saw enough of in any case.{{Sfn|Fink|1998|p=50}}{{Refn|Carole Fink describes the meetings Bloch had with his family: "In February 1940 he made two trips to Paris—displaying signs of 'fatigue'—where he saw his wife, visited relatives and friends, and savored the joys of civilian life: a sandwich in a café, a concert, and several good films.{{sfn|Fink|1998|p=50}}|group=note}} Some academics had escaped France for [[The New School]] in [[New York City]], and the School also invited Bloch

in neutral gear, nor any pride more vainly misplaced than that in a tool valued as an end in itself".{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=270 271}}{{Sfn|Bloch|1963|p=87}} He believed it was wrong for historians to focus on the evidence rather than the human condition of whatever period they were discussing.{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=270 271}} Administrative historians, he said, understood every element of a government department without understanding anything of those who worked in it.{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=280}}

Bloch was very much influenced by [[Ferdinand Lot]], who had already written comparative history,{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|p=181}} and by the work of [[Jules Michelet]] and [[Fustel de Coulanges]] with their emphasis on social history, Durkheim's sociological methodology, [[François Simiand|François Simiand's]] social economics, and [[Henri Bergson|Henri Bergson's]] philosophy of [[collectivism]].{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|p=181}} Bloch's emphasis on using comparative history harked back to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when writers such as [[Voltaire]] and [[Montesquieu]] decried the notion that history was a linear narrative of individuals and pushed for a greater  use of philosophy in studying the past.{{Sfn|Sreedharan|2004|p=258}} Bloch condemned the "German-dominated" school of [[political economy]], which he considered "analytically unsophisticated and riddled with distortions".{{Sfn|Fink|1991|p=37}} Equally condemned were then-fashionable ideas on [[Racial identity|racial theories]] of [[national identity]].{{Sfn|Fink|1991|p=44}} Bloch believed that political history on its own could not explain deeper [[socioeconomics]] trends and influences.{{Sfn|Rhodes|1999|p=133}}

Bloch did not see social history as being a separate field within historical research
0.115438
As Burguière has pointed out, and Bloch would have known, taking such a position would effectively "indict all Jews who did not join".{{Sfn|Burguière|2009|p=47}} Burguière has pinpointed Bloch's motive for joining the Resistance in his characteristic refusal to mince his words or play half a role.{{Sfn|Burguière|2009|p=48}} Bloch had previously expressed the view that "there can be no salvation where there is not some sacrifice".{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=268}} He sent his family away, and returned to Lyon to join the underground.{{Sfn|Fink|1995|p=208}}

In spite of knowing a number of [[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans|''francs-tireurs'']] around Lyon, Bloch still found it difficult to join them because of his age.{{Sfn|Burguière|2009|p=47}} Although the Resistance recruited heavily among university lecturers{{Sfn|Geremek|1986|p=1104}}—and indeed, Bloch's [[alma mater]], the École Normale Superieur, provided it with many members{{Sfn|Smith|1982|p=268}}—he commented in exasperation to Simonne that he "didn't know it is so difficult to offer one's life".{{Sfn|Burguière|2009|p=47}} The French historian and philosopher [[François Dosse]] quotes a member of the ''franc-tireurs'' active with Bloch as later describing how "that eminent professor came to put himself at our command simply and modestly".{{Sfn|Dosse|1994|p=44}} Bloch utilised his professional and military skills on their behalf, writing propaganda for them and organising their supplies and [[materiel]], becoming a regional organiser.{{Sfn|Fink|1995|p=208}} Bloch also joined the ''[[Mouvements Unis de la Résistance]]'' (Unified Resistance Movement, or MUR),{{Sfn|Dosse|1994|p=44}} section R1,{{sfn|Wieviorka|2016|p=102}} and edited the underground newsletter, ''Cahiers Politique''.{{Sfn|Fink|1995|p=208}} He went under various pseudonyms: Arpajon, Chevreuse, Narbonne.{{Sfn|Fink|1995|p=208}}{{Refn|Bloch's pseudonyms tended to hark back to his life living on Paris' [[Left Bank]] in the 1930s
0.11547
He was not, though, particularly critical of English historiography, and respected the long tradition of rural history in that country as well as more materially the government funding that went into historical research there.{{Sfn|Raftis|1999|p=64}}

It is possible, argues Weber, that had Bloch survived the war, he would have stood to be appointed [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Minister of Education]] in a post-war government and reformed the education system he had condemned for losing France the war in 1940.{{Sfn|Weber|1991|p=253}} Instead, in 1948, his son Étienne offered the [[Archives Nationales (France)|Archives Nationales]] his father's papers for repository, but they rejected the offer

As an academic, he worked at the [[University of Strasbourg]] (1920 to 1936), the [[University of Paris]] (1936 to 1939), and the [[University of Montpellier]] (1941 to 1944)

In ''Feudal Society'' he used research from the broadest range of disciplines to date to examine feudalism in the broadest possible way—most notably including a study of [[feudal Japan]].{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=531}} He also compared areas where feudalism was imposed, rather than organically developed (such as England after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]]) and where it was never established (such as Scotland and Scandinavia).{{Sfn|Hughes-Warrington|2015|p=15}} Bloch defined feudal society as, "from the peasants' point of view",{{Sfn|Evergates|1993|p=xvii}} politically fragmentary, where they are ruled by an aristocratic upper-class.{{Sfn|Evergates|1993|p=xvii}}

Daniel Chirot has described ''The Royal Touch'', ''French Rural History'' and ''Feudal Society''—all of which concentrate on the French Middle Ages—as Bloch's most significant works.{{Sfn|Chirot|1984|pp=22–23}} Conversely, his last two—''[[The Historian's Craft]]'' and ''Strange Defeat''—have been described as unrepresentative of his historical approach in that they discuss contemporary events in which Bloch was personally involved and without access to primary sources.{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=531}} ''Strange Defeat'' was uncompleted at the time of his death, and both were published posthumously in 1949.{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=531}}{{Sfn|Loyn|1999|p=167}} Davies has described ''The Historian's Craft as'' "beautifully sensitive and profound";{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=265}} the book was written in response to his son, Étienne, asking his father, "what is history?".{{Sfn|Hughes-Warrington|2015|p=16}} In his introduction, Bloch wrote to Febvre.{{Sfn|Hughes-Warrington|2015|p=16}}

He rejected the political and biographical history which up until that point was the norm,{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|p=181}} along with what  the historian George Huppert has described as a "laborious cult of facts" that accompanied it.{{Sfn|Huppert|1982|p=510}} In 1920, with the opening of the  [[University of Strasbourg]],{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=529}} Bloch was appointed ''chargé de cours''{{Sfn|Friedman|1996|p=10}} ([[assistant lecturer]]){{sfn|Fink|1991|p=84}} of medieval history.{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=267}} [[Alsace-Lorraine]] had been returned to France with the [[Treaty of Versailles]]; the status of the region was a [[November 1918 in Alsace-Lorraine|contentious political issue]] in Strasbourg, its capital, which had a large German population.{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=529}} Bloch, however, refused to take either side in the debate; indeed, he appears to have avoided politics entirely.{{Sfn|Friedman|1996|p=10}} Under [[Wilhelmine Germany]], Strasbourg had rivalled Berlin as a centre for intellectual advancement, and the University of Strasbourg possessed the largest academic library in the world

However, says the historian [[Daniel Hochedez]], Bloch was aware of his role as both a "witness and narrator" to events and wanted as detailed a basis for his historiographical understanding as possible.{{sfn|Hochedez|2012|p=61}} The historian Rees Davies notes that although Bloch served in the war with "considerable distinction",{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=267}} it had come at the worst possible time both for his intellectual development and his study of medieval society.{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=267}}

For the first time in his life, Bloch later wrote, he worked and lived alongside people he had never had close contact with before, such as shop workers and labourers,{{Sfn|Lyon|1987|p=198}} with whom he developed a great [[camaraderie]].{{Sfn|Lyon|1987|p=199}} It was a completely different world to the one he was used to, being "a world where differences were settled not by words but by bullets".{{Sfn|Lyon|1987|p=198}} His experiences made him rethink his views on history,{{Sfn|Lyon|1987|p=200}} and influenced his subsequent approach to the world in general.{{Sfn|Burguière|2009|p=38}} He was particularly moved by the collective psychology he witnessed in the [[WWI trenches|trenches]].{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=528}} He later declared he knew of no better men than "the men of the Nord and the Pas de Calais"{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|p=184}} with whom he had spent four years in close quarters.{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|p=184}}{{Refn|Bloch later recalled that he had seen only one exception to this collective spirit, and that that was a by "'scab', by which I mean a non-unionist employed as a strike-breaker".{{sfn|Lyon|1985|p=184}}|group=note}} His few references to the French generals were sparse and sardonic.{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|p=185}}

=== Upbringing and education ===
Bloch's biographer Karen Stirling ascribed significance to the era in which Bloch was born: the middle of the [[French Third Republic]], so "after those who had founded it and before the generation that would aggressively challenge it".{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=527}}{{Refn|The latter generation included nationalist [[Boulangists]] and crises such as the [[Panama scandals]] in the last decade of the nineteenth century.{{sfn|Friedman|1996|p=6}}|group=note}} When Bloch was nine-years-old, the [[Dreyfus affair]] broke out in France

Bloch, however, showed that Venice was as wealthy as these two states, yet did not issue gold for many more years; the reason, he posited, was because Genoa and Florence, at that time, traded with the east, whose traders commonly paid in gold; Venice, on the other hand, had an important trade with the [[Levant]], but was generally paid in silver, and so failed to accumulate gold.{{sfn|Sewell|1967|p=209}}|group=note}} Although one of his best essays, according to Davies—"Liberté et servitude personelles au Moyen Age, particulement en France"—was not published when it could have been; this, he remarked was "an unpardonable omission".{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=267}}

}}Davies says Bloch was "no mean disputant"{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=268}} in [[historiographical]] debate, often [[Reductio ad absurdum|reducing an opponent's argument]] to its most basic weaknesses.{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=268}} His approach was a reaction against the prevailing ideas within French historiography of the day which, when he was young, were still very much based on that of the German School, pioneered by [[Leopold von Ranke]].{{Refn|Von Ranke summed up his philosophy of history in the [[dictum]]: "the strict presentation of the facts, contingent and unattractive though they may be, is undoubtedly the supreme law".{{sfn|Blumenau|2002|p=578}}|group=note}} Within French historiography this led to a forensic focus on [[administrative history]] as expounded by historians such as  [[Ernest Lavisse]].{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=280}} While he acknowledged his and his generation of historians' debt to their predecessors, he considered that they treated historical research as being little more meaningful than detective work

He wrote in ''Strange Defeat'' that a fast, motorised retreat might have saved the army.{{Sfn|Chirot|1984|p=42}}

Two-thirds of France was occupied by Germany.{{Sfn|Hughes-Warrington|2015|p=15}} Bloch, one of the only elderly academics to volunteer,{{Sfn|Fink|1998|p=42}} was demobilised soon after [[Philippe Pétain]]'s government signed the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]] forming [[Vichy France]] in the remaining southern-third of the country.{{Sfn|Fink|1998|p=39}} Bloch moved south, where in January 1941, he applied for and received{{Sfn|Birnbaum|2007|p=251 n.92}} one of only ten exemptions to the ban on employing Jewish academics the Vichy government made.{{Sfn|Epstein|1993|p=276}} This was probably due to Bloch's pre-eminence in the field of history.{{Sfn|Fink|1995|p=208}} He was allowed to work{{Sfn|Epstein|1993|p=276}} at the "University of Strasbourg-in-exile",{{Sfn|Fink|1995|p=208}} the universities of  [[University of Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont-Ferrand]], and Montpellier.{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=268}} The latter, further south, was beneficial to his wife's health, which was in decline.{{Sfn|Hughes|2002|p=127}} The [[Dean (education)|dean of faculty]] at Montpellier was [[Augustin Fliche]], an [[ecclesiastical historian]] of the Middle Ages, who, according to Weber, "made no secret of his antisemitism".{{Sfn|Weber|1991|pp=253–254}} He disliked Bloch further for having once given him a poor [[Peer review|review]].{{Sfn|Weber|1991|pp=253–254}} Fliche not only opposed Bloch's transfer to Montpellier but made his life uncomfortable when he was there.{{Sfn|Weber|1991|p=254}} The Vichy government was attempting to promote itself as a return to traditional French values.{{Sfn|Levine|2010|p=15}} Bloch condemned this as propaganda; the rural idyll that Vichy said it would return France to was impossible, he said, "because the idyllic, docile peasant life of the French right had never existed".{{Sfn|Chirot|1984|p=43}}

Bloch's mother had recently died, and his wife was ill; furthermore, although he was permitted to work and live, he faced daily harassment.{{Sfn|Fink|1995|p=208}} On 18 March 1941, Bloch made his [[Will and testament|will]] in Clermont-Ferrand.{{Sfn|Loyn|1999|p=163}} The Polish social historian [[Bronisław Geremek]] suggests that this document hints at Bloch in some way foreseeing his death,{{Sfn|Geremek|1986|p=1103}} as he emphasised that nobody had the right to avoid fighting for their country.{{Sfn|Geremek|1986|p=1105}} In March 1942 Bloch and other French academics such as [[Georges Friedmann]] and [[Émile Benveniste]], refused to join or condone the establishment of the [[Judenrat|Union Générale des Israelites des France]] by the Vichy government, a group intended to include all Jews in France, both of birth and immigration.{{Sfn|Birnbaum|2007|p=248}}

As the first major display of political [[antisemitism]] in Europe, it was probably a formative event of Bloch's youth,{{Sfn|Fink|1991|p=19}}{{Refn|In ''The Historian's Craft'', Bloch describes himself as one of "the last of the generation of the Dreyfus Affair".{{sfn|Bloch|1963|p=154}}|group=note}} along with, more generally, the atmosphere of ''[[fin de siècle]]'' Paris.{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=527}} Bloch was 11 when [[Émile Zola]] published ''[[J'Accuse…!]]'', his indictment of the French establishment's antisemitism and corruption.{{Sfn|Hughes-Warrington|2015|p=10}} Bloch was greatly affected by the Dreyfus affair, but even more affected was nineteenth-century France generally, and his father's employer, the École Normale Supérieure, saw existing divides in French society reinforced in every debate.{{Sfn|Friedman|1996|p=6}} Gustave Bloch was closely involved in the [[Dreyfusard]] movement and his son agreed with the cause.{{Sfn|Friedman|1996|p=6}}

Bloch was educated at the prestigious [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] for three years, where he was consistently head of his class and won prizes in French, history, Latin and natural history.{{Sfn|Friedman|1996|p=7}} He passed his ''[[baccalauréat]]'', in Letters and Philosophy, in July 1903, being graded ''trés bien'' (very good).{{Sfn|Fink|1991|p=24}} The following year,{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=527}} he received a [[scholarship]]{{Sfn|Fink|1991|p=24}} and undertook postgraduate study there for the École normale supérieure (ÉNS){{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=527}} (where his father had  been appointed ''[[maître de conferences]]'' in 1887).{{Sfn|Friedman|1996|p=4}} His father had been nicknamed ''le Méga'' by his students at the ÉNS and the moniker ''Microméga'' was bestowed upon Bloch.{{Sfn|Schöttler|2010|p=415}}{{Refn|His father's nickname was a reference to the skeleton of a ''[[megatherium]]'' which was housed in the ÉNS.{{sfn|Friedman|1996|p=7}}|group=note}} Here he was taught history by [[Christian Pfister]]{{Sfn|Lyon|1987|p=198}} and [[Charles Seignobos]], who led a relatively new school of historical thought which saw history as broad themes punctuated by tumultuous events.{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=527}} Another important influence on Bloch from this period was his father's contemporary, the sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], who pre-figured Bloch's own later emphasis on cross-disciplinary research.{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=527}} The same year, Bloch visited England; he later recalled being struck more by the number of homeless people on the [[Victoria Embankment]] than the new Entente Cordiale relationship between the two countries.{{Sfn|Fink|1991|pp=24–25}}

Although it helped mould Bloch's ideas for the future, it did not, says Bryce Loyn, give any indication of the originality of thought that Bloch would later be known for,{{Sfn|Lyon|1987|p=198}} and was not vastly different to what others had written on the subject.{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|p=183}} Following his graduation, he taught at two [[lycée]]s,{{Sfn|Lyon|1987|p=198}} first in Montpelier, a minor university town of 66,000 inhabitants.{{Sfn|Fink|1991|p=46}} With Bloch working over 16 hours a week on his classes, there was little time for him to work on his thesis.{{Sfn|Fink|1991|p=46}} He also taught at the [[University of Amiens]].{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=267}} While there, he wrote a review of Febvre's first book, ''Histoire de Franche-Comté''.{{Sfn|Hughes-Warrington|2015|p=12}} Bloch intended to turn his thesis into a book, but the First World War intervened.{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=269}}{{Refn|Bloch did, however, continually refer back to this research throughout the rest of his career, and [[Guy Fourquin]]'s 1963 monograph ''Les campagnes de la rdgion parisienne li la fin du moyen age'' effectively completed the study.{{sfn|Davies|1967|p=269}}|group=note}}

Bloch felt that the French Army lacked the ''[[esprit de corps]]'' or "fervent fraternity"{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|p=184}} of the French Army in the First World War.{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|p=184}} He saw the French generals of 1940 as behaving as unimaginatively as [[Joseph Joffre]] had in the first war.{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|p=187}} He did not, however, believe that the earlier war was an indication of how the next would progress: "no two successive wars", he wrote in 1940, "are ever the same war".{{Sfn|Lyon|1985|p=189}}

To Bloch, France collapsed because her  generals failed to capitalise on the best qualities humanity possessed—character and intelligence{{Sfn|Davies|1967|p=281}}—because of their own "sluggish and intractable" progress since World War I.{{Sfn|Stirling|2007|p=533}} He was horrified by the defeat which, Carole Fink has suggested, he saw as being worse, for both France and the world, than her previous defeats at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] and [[Battle of Sedan|Sedan]].{{Sfn|Fink|1998|p=39}} Bloch understood the reasons for France's sudden defeat: not in the rumours of British betrayal, communist [[fifth column]]s or fascist plots, but in her failure to [[Motorized infantry|motorise]], and perhaps more importantly, her failure to understand what motorisation meant
