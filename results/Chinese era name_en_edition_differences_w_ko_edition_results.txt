'''Chinese era names''' were titles used by various [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Chinese dynasties]] and regimes in [[History of China#Imperial China|Imperial China]] for the purpose of [[regnal year|year identification and numbering]]
1.48135e-09
Numerous attempts to reinstate monarchical rule in China had resulted in the declaration of additional era names after the founding of the Republic, but these regimes and their associated era names were short-lived

Modern history researchers do not care about era names except for supporting other arguments, such as figuring out the biases and attitudes of a particular historian;{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} however, era names are useful for dating events that were unique in Chinese history

The concept of era name also saw its adoption by neighboring [[Korean era name|Korea]] and [[Vietnamese era name|Vietnam]] since the middle of the 6th century CE, and by [[Japanese era name|Japan]] since the middle of the 7th century CE.<ref name=First2></ref><ref name=Sinosphere></ref><ref name=Japan></ref> Notably, Japan still officially retains the use of era names today.<ref name=Japan></ref>

==Era system versus Western dating system==

While the era system is a more traditional system of dating that preserves Chinese and Japanese culture, it presents a problem for the more globalized Asian society and for everyday life

==History==
The [[Emperor Wu of Han]] is conventionally regarded as the first ruler to declare an era name.<ref name=First1></ref><ref name=First2></ref> Prior to the introduction of the first era name in 140 BCE, Chinese monarchs utilized the ''Qianyuan'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|前元}}), ''Zhongyuan'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|中元}}) and ''Houyuan'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|後元}}) systems to identify and number years
0.0021756

On the other hand, others{{who|date=August 2015}} suggest that the AD system has too much Christian connotation behind it and it is a form of [[cultural imperialism]] when an essentially European system of dating is forced upon other civilizations with their own long-used and equally legitimate dating systems
0.00233041
In addition, while Republic of China (ROC) and Japan only recognize documents dated in the Era System, their treaties with other countries are in the [[Dionysian Era]] ([[Anno Domini|AD]]) system
0.00299148

The [[Hongwu Emperor]] started the tradition of having only one era name for one monarch—known as the ''yī shì yī yuán zhì'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|一世一元制}}; lit
0.0040359

When a new monarch ascended to the throne, he could either declare a new era immediately or inherit the usage of the existing era name from his predecessor
0.00576084
Hence, most Chinese monarchs would proclaim a new era upon the founding of a new dynasty
0.00581833

With the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1912 CE, the Chinese era name system was superseded by the [[Republic of China calendar]] which remains in official use in the [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan Area]]

Prior to the [[Ming dynasty]], it was common for Chinese sovereigns to change the era name during their reigns, resulting in the use of more than one era name for one ruler
0.0248811
Notable exceptions to this "one-era-name" tradition included [[Emperor Yingzong of Ming|Zhu Qizhen]] who proclaimed two era names for his two separate reigns, [[Hong Taiji|Aisin Gioro Hong Taiji]] who used two era names to reflect his position as khan of the [[Later Jin (1616–1636)|Later Jin]] and later as emperor of the Qing dynasty, as well as [[Puyi|Aisin Gioro Puyi]] who adopted three era names in his capacity as emperor of the Qing dynasty and subsequently as ruler of [[Manchukuo]]

Declaring an era name to replace an existing era name was known as ''gǎiyuán'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|改元}}; lit

Instituting a new era name would reset the numbering of the year back to year one or ''yuán'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|元}})
0.0513899

The numbering of the year would still increase on the first day of the Chinese calendar each year, regardless of the month in which the era name change took place
0.0531195

Also, while ROC and Japan both continue to use the ancient Chinese era system, since they have partially adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]] for non-governmental use, it is more difficult to track down dates that fall on February 29 [[leap year]] in the Western calendar
