6.09361e-11
Many types of luminescence techniques are utilized in geology, including [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL), [[cathodoluminescence]] (CL), and [[thermoluminescence]] (TL)

Absolute geochronology can be accomplished through [[radioactive isotopes]], whereas relative geochronology is provided by tools such as [[palaeomagnetism]] and [[stable isotope ratio]]s

== Differences from chronostratigraphy ==
It is important not to confuse geochronologic and chronostratigraphic units.<ref>David Weishampel: ''The Evolution and Extinction of the Dinosaurs'', 1996, Cambridge Press, {{ISBN|0-521-44496-9}}</ref> Geochronological units are periods of time, thus it is correct to say that ''[[Tyrannosaurus]] rex'' lived during the Late [[Cretaceous]] Epoch.<ref>Julia Jackson: ''Glossary of Geology'', 1987, American Geological Institute, {{ISBN|0-922152-34-9}}</ref> Chronostratigraphic units are geological material, so it is also correct to say that fossils of the genus ''Tyrannosaurus'' have been found in the Upper Cretaceous Series.<ref>Smith, J.B., Lamanna, M.C., Lacovara, K.J., Dodson, P

'''Geochronology''' is the [[science]] of [[Chronological dating|determining the age]] of [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[fossil]]s, and [[sediment]]s using signatures inherent in the rocks themselves
0.176906
Its range is from a few years to about 700,000 years
0.265359
A number of radioactive isotopes are used for this purpose, and depending on the rate of decay, are used for dating different geological periods
0.265359
Thermoluminescence and optically stimulated luminescence are used in archaeology to date 'fired' objects such as pottery or cooking stones and can be used to observe sand migration
0.297093

=== Luminescence dating ===
Luminescence dating techniques observe 'light' emitted from materials such as quartz, diamond, feldspar, and calcite
