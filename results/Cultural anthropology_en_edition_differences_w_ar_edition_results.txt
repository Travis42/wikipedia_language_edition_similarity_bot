He states in the widely circulated 1984 book ''A critique of the study of kinship'' that "[K]inship has been defined by European social scientists, and European social scientists use their own folk culture as the source of many, if not all of their ways of formulating and understanding the world about them".<ref>{{Cite book|title=A critique of the study of kinship|last=Schneider|first=David M.|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=1984|isbn=|location=Ann Arbor|pages=}}</ref> However, this critique has been challenged by the argument that it is linguistics, not cultural divergence, that has allowed for a European bias, and that the bias can be lifted by centering the methodology on fundamental human concepts

Observable details (like daily time allotment) and more hidden details (like [[taboo]] behavior) are more easily observed and interpreted over a longer period of time, and researchers can discover discrepancies between what participants say—and often believe—should happen (the [[formal system]]) and what actually does happen, or between different aspects of the formal system; in contrast, a one-time survey of people's answers to a set of questions might be quite consistent, but is less likely to show conflicts between different aspects of the social system or between conscious representations and behavior.<ref name="DeWalt">DeWalt, K

==Topics in cultural anthropology==

===Kinship and family===
{{main|Kinship}}
Kinship refers to the anthropological study of the ways in which humans form and maintain relationships with one another, and further, how those relationships operate within and define social organization.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Cultural Anthropology: A Toolkit for a Global Age|last=Guest|first=Kenneth J.|publisher=W.W

Other themes that emerged during this time included the frequent comparisons between Eastern and Western kinship systems and the increasing amount of attention paid to anthropologists' own societies, a swift turn from the focus that had traditionally been paid to largely "foreign", non-Western communities.<ref name=":1" />

Kinship studies began to gain mainstream recognition in the late 1990s with the surging popularity of feminist anthropology, particularly with its work related to biological anthropology and the intersectional critique of gender relations

Who the ethnographer is has a lot to do with what he or she will eventually write about a culture, because each researcher is influenced by his or her own perspective.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Culture and Truth|last=Rosaldo|first=Renato|publisher=Beacon Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=Boston, MA|pages=}}</ref> This is considered a problem especially when anthropologists write in the ethnographic present, a present tense which makes a culture seem stuck in time, and ignores the fact that it may have interacted with other cultures or gradually evolved since the anthropologist made observations.<ref name=":4" /> To avoid this, past ethnographers have advocated for strict training, or for anthropologists working in teams

 One such method is that of [[ethnography]]: basically, they advocated living with people of another culture for an extended period of time, so that they could learn the local language and be enculturated, at least partially, into that culture

This allows the anthropologist to develop trusting relationships with the subjects of study and receive an inside perspective on the culture, which helps him or her to give a richer description when writing about the culture later

Modern cultural anthropology has its origins in, and developed in reaction to, 19th century [[ethnology]], which involves the organized comparison of human societies

The anthropological concept of "culture" reflects in part a reaction against earlier Western [[discourse]]s based on an opposition between "[[culture]]" and "[[nature]]", according to which some human beings lived in a "state of nature".{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Anthropologists have argued that culture ''is'' "human nature", and that all people have a capacity to classify [[experience]]s, encode classifications symbolically (i.e

Common considerations taken by anthropologists in studying institutions include the physical location at which a researcher places themselves, as important interactions often take place in private, and the fact that the members of an institution are often being examined in their workplace and may not have much idle time to discuss the details of their everyday endeavors.<ref name=":42">{{Cite book|title=The Network Inside Out|last=Riles|first=Annelise|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The ability of individuals to present the workings of an institution in a particular light or frame must additionally be taken into account when using interviews and document analysis to understand an institution,<ref name=":32" /> as the involvement of an anthropologist may be met with distrust when information being released to the public is not directly controlled by the institution and could potentially be damaging.<ref name=":42" />
