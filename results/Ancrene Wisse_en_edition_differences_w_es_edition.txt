Dobson argues that the anchoresses were enclosed near Limebrook in Herefordshire, and that the author was an Augustinian canon at nearby [[Wigmore Abbey]] in [[Herefordshire]] named Brian of Lingen.{{sfn|Dobson|1975}} Bella Millett has subsequently argued that the author was in fact a Dominican rather than an Augustinian, though this remains controversial.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The revision of the work contained in the manuscript held at Corpus Christi, Cambridge (used by most modern translations) can be dated between 1224 and 1235.{{sfn|Watson|Savage|1991|p=42}} The date of the first writing of the work is more controversial, and tends to depend upon one's view of the influence of the pastoral reforms of the 1215 [[Fourth Lateran Council]].
