discovered that OSL and radiocarbon dates agreed in some samples, but the radiocarbon dates were up to 5800 years older in others.<ref name = "Lee 2011">{{Cite journal|author= Lee, M.K., Lee, Y.I., Lim, H.S., Lee, J.I., Choi, J.H., & Yoon, H.I

For example,  in quartz a short daylight exposure in the range of 1–100 seconds before burial is sufficient to effectively “reset” the OSL dating clock.<ref name = "Rhodes 2011" /> This is usually, but not always, the case with [[Aeolian processes|aeolian]] deposits, such as sand dunes and [[loess]], and some water-laid deposits

The [[photon]]s of the emitted light must have higher energies than the excitation photons in order to avoid measurement of ordinary [[photoluminescence]]

In multiple-aliquot testing, a number of grains of sand are stimulated at the same time and the resulting luminescence signature is averaged <ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Jacobs, Z and Roberts, R|date=2007|title=Advances in Optically Stimulated Luminescence Dating of Individual Grains of Quartz from Archaeological Deposits|url=|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology|volume=16|pages=218|via=}}</ref>

==Minerals==
The minerals that are measured are usually either quartz or potassium feldspar sand-sized grains, or unseparated silt-sized grains

It includes techniques such as [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL), infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL), and [[thermoluminescence dating]] (TL)
0.0871489
Stimulating these mineral grains using either light (blue or green for OSL; [[infrared]] for IRSL) or heat (for TL) causes a luminescence signal to be emitted as the stored unstable electron energy is released, the intensity of which varies depending on the amount of radiation absorbed during burial and specific properties of the mineral

{{short description|Form of dating how long ago mineral grains had been last exposed to sunlight or heating}}
'''Luminescence dating''' refers to a group of methods of determining how long ago [[mineral]] grains were last exposed to sunlight or sufficient heating

In contrast to the multiple-aliquot method, the SAR method tests the burial ages of individual grains of sand which are then plotted

==Comparison to radiocarbon dating==
Unlike [[radiocarbon dating|carbon-14 dating]], luminescence dating methods do not require a contemporary organic component of the sediment to be dated; just quartz, potassium feldspar, or certain other mineral grains that have been fully bleached during the event being dated
0.290496
The total absorbed radiation dose is determined by exciting, with light, specific minerals (usually [[quartz]] or [[potassium feldspar]]) extracted from the sample, and measuring the amount of light emitted as a result
