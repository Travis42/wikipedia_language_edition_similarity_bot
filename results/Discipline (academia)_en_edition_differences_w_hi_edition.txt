Discipline (academia)

en edition's differences with the hi version: 


1. 
With rare exceptions, practitioners of science tended to be amateurs and were referred to as "natural historians" and "natural philosophers"—labels that date back to Aristotle—instead of "scientists".<ref>{{cite web |title=How The Word 'Scientist' Came To Be |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127037417 |website=npr.org |publisher=National Public Radio |accessdate=November 3, 2014}}</ref> Natural history referred to what we now call life sciences and natural philosophy referred to the current physical sciences.

While academic disciplines in and of themselves are more or less focused practices, scholarly approaches such as [[Interdisciplinarity|multidisciplinarity/interdisciplinarity]], [[transdisciplinarity]], and [[cross-disciplinarity]] integrate aspects from multiple academic disciplines, therefore addressing any problems that may arise from narrow concentration within specialized fields of study. 

7. 
Foucault asserts that academic disciplines originate from the same social movements and mechanisms of control that established the modern prison and penal system in eighteenth-century [[France]], and that this fact reveals essential aspects they continue to have in common: "The disciplines characterize, classify, specialize; they distribute along a scale, around a norm, hierarchize individuals in relation to one another and, if necessary, disqualify and invalidate." (Foucault, 1975/1979, p.

Eventually, academia's identified disciplines became the foundations for scholars of specific specialized interests and expertise.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cohen |first1=E |last2=Lloyd |first2=S |title=Disciplinary Evolution and the Rise of Transdiscipline |url=http://www.inform.nu/Articles/Vol17/ISJv17p189-215Cohen0702.pdf |publisher=Informing Science: the International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline}}</ref>

==Functions and criticism==
An influential critique of the concept of academic disciplines came from [[Michel Foucault]] in his 1975 book, ''[[Discipline and Punish]]''. 

9. 
While interdisciplinary teams may be creating new knowledge that lies between several existing disciplines, a transdisciplinary team is more holistic and seeks to relate all disciplines into a coherent whole.

==Bibliometric studies of disciplines==
[[Bibliometrics]] can be used to map several issues in relation to disciplines, for example the flow of ideas within and among disciplines (Lindholm-Romantschuk, 1998)<ref>Lindholm-Romantschuk, Y.

Most academic disciplines have their roots in the mid-to-late-nineteenth century [[secularization]] of universities, when the traditional [[curriculum|curricula]] were supplemented with non-classical languages and [[literatures]], [[social sciences]] such as [[political science]], [[economics]], [[sociology]] and [[public administration]], and [[natural science]] and [[technology]] disciplines such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[engineering]].

The Bibliometrics approach is described as straightforward because it is based on simple counting.
