Every time a cell divides the telomere becomes a bit shorter; when it is finally worn down, the cell is unable to split and dies

With the presence of telomerase, each dividing cell can replace the lost bit of [[DNA]], and any single cell can then divide unbounded

It was found that those mice which were "[[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] to produce 10 times the normal levels of telomerase lived 50% longer than normal mice".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/3489881/Scientists-take-a-step-closer-to-an-elixir-of-youth.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Scientists take a step closer to an elixir of youth |first=Richard |last=Alleyne |date=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>

The belief in an ''[[afterlife]]'' is a fundamental tenet of most religions, including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]]; however, the concept of an immortal [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is not

Wright says [[John Polkinghorne]], a physicist and a priest, has put it this way: 'God will download our software onto his hardware until the time he gives us new hardware to run the software again for ourselves.' That gets to two things nicely: that the period after death (the [[Intermediate state]]) is a period when we are in God's presence but not active in our own bodies, and also that the more important transformation will be when we are again embodied and administering [[World to Come|Christ's kingdom]]."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1710844,00.html |work=Time |title=Christians Wrong About Heaven, Says Bishop&#13; |date=February 7, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2010 |first=David |last=Van Biema}}</ref> This kingdom will consist of [[World to Come|Heaven and Earth "joined together in a new creation"]], he said

The exact form of his argument is unclear, but it appears to have influenced Plato, Aristotle, and other later writers.<ref name="alcmaeon">https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/alcmaeon/#immort</ref>

===Plato===
[[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'' advances four arguments for the soul's immortality:<ref>https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/</ref>

* The [[Phaedo#The Cyclical Argument|Cyclical Argument]], or Opposites Argument explains that [[Theory of forms|Forms]] are eternal and unchanging, and as the soul always brings life, then it must not die, and is necessarily "imperishable"
2.1555e-10
In the Phaedon, Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that Kant calls the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology)
2.1555e-10
As Kagan notes, his argument is an adaptation of a similar argument given by the British philosopher [[Bernard Williams]] in his book ''Problems of the Self'' (1973).</ref>

== Sociology ==

If human beings were to achieve immortality, there would most likely be a change in the worlds' [[social structures]]
5.80258e-10
The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear
6.20446e-10

====Aging====
[[Aubrey de Grey]], a leading researcher in the field,<ref name="Garreau"/> defines [[aging]] as "a collection of cumulative changes to the [[molecular]] and [[cell (biology)|cellular]] structure of an adult [[organism]], which result in essential [[metabolic]] processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in [[pathology]] and death." The current causes of aging in humans are cell loss (without replacement), [[DNA damage theory of aging|DNA damage]], [[oncology|oncogenic]] [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] [[mutation]]s and [[epimutation]]s, cell [[senescence]], [[mitochondria]]l mutations, [[lysosomal]] aggregates, extracellular aggregates, random extracellular cross-linking, [[immune system]] decline, and [[endocrine]] changes

As may be witnessed even into the Christian era, not least by the complaints of various philosophers over popular beliefs, many or perhaps most traditional Greeks maintained the conviction that certain individuals were resurrected from the dead and made physically immortal and that others could only look forward to an existence as disembodied and dead, though everlasting, souls

Accordingly, the Hebrew word ''[[nephesh]]'', although translated as "soul" in some older English Bibles, actually has a meaning closer to "living being".{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''Nephesh'' was rendered in the [[Septuagint]] as ''{{lang|grc|ψυχή}}'' (''psūchê''), the Greek word for soul.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

For example, in the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] (Chapter 2, Verse 12), it is stated "When earth, water, fire, air and sky arise, that is to say, when the five attributes of the elements, mentioned in the books on yoga, become manifest then the yogi's body becomes purified by the fire of yoga and he is free from illness, old age and death."

Another view of immortality is traced to the Vedic tradition by the interpretation of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]:
