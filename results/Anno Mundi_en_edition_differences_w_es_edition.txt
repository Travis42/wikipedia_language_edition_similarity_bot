Because this is just before midnight when the Western day begins, but after 6 pm when the Jewish calendrical day begins (equivalent to the next tabular day with the same daylight period), its Julian calendar date is 6/7 October 3761 BCE (Gregorian: 6/7 September 3761 BCE or −3760).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://strangeside.com/calendar-when-does-it-start/ | title=Calendar — when does it start | website=strangeside.com | access-date=October 23, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/hebrew.php | title=The Hebrew Calendar | last=Tøndering | first=Claus | date=2014 | website=www.tondering.dk | access-date=October 23, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://hebrewcalendar.tripod.com/luachmail.html#029 | title=Is Creation at AM 1 or AM 2.

The primary reason for the disparity seems to lie in which underlying biblical text is chosen (roughly 5500 BC based on the Greek Septuagint text, about 3760 BC based on the Hebrew Masoretic text).

Ben Zion Wacholder points out that the writings of the [[Church Fathers]] on this subject are of vital significance (even though he disagrees with their chronological system based on the authenticity of the [[Septuagint]], as compared to that of the [[Masoretic Text|Hebrew text]]), in that through the Christian chronographers a window to the earlier Hellenistic biblical chronographers{{refn|1=[[Eratosthenes|Eratosthenes of Cyrene ]] (275–194 BC) represented contemporary Alexandrian scholarship; [[Eupolemus]], a Palestinian Jew and a friend of [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah Maccabee]], writing in 158 BC, is said to have been the first historian who synchronized Greek history in accordance with the theory of the Mosaic origin of culture.

Two such calendar eras have seen notable use historically:

The first year of the Jewish calendar, Anno Mundi 1 (AM 1), began about one year before creation, so that year is also called the Year of emptiness.
