Chronostratigraphy

For instance, there may be many millions of years between a bed being laid down and an intrusive rock cutting it; the estimate of age must necessarily be between the oldest cross-cutting intrusive rock in the fossil assemblage and the youngest rock upon which the fossil assemblage rests

The aim of chronostratigraphy is to give a meaningful [[geochronology|age date]] to these fossil assemblage intervals and interfaces.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Methodology ==
Chronostratigraphy relies heavily upon [[isotope geology]] and [[geochronology]] to derive hard dating of known and well defined rock units which contain the specific fossil assemblages defined by the stratigraphic system
0.144905

Because [[igneous]] rocks occur at specific intervals in time and are essentially instantaneous on a geologic time scale, and because they contain mineral assemblages which may be dated more accurately and precisely by isotopic methods, the construction of a chronostratigraphic column relies heavily upon intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks
