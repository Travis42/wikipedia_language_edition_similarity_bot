This thought is indeed also noted in a posthumous fragment.<ref>1881 (11 [143])</ref> The origin of this thought is dated by Nietzsche himself, via posthumous fragments, to August 1881, at [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils-Maria]]

If [[space]] and time are infinite, then it follows logically that our existence must recur an infinite number of times.<ref>Tegmark M., "Parallel universes"

[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] suggests that Nietzsche may have encountered this idea in the works of [[Heinrich Heine]], who once wrote:

<blockquote>[T]ime is infinite, but the things in time, the concrete bodies, are finite

Suppose there were three wheels of equal size, rotating on the same axis, one point marked on the circumference of each wheel, and these three points lined up in one straight line

However, he also expresses his thought at greater length when he says to his reader:

<blockquote>"Whoever thou mayest be, beloved stranger, whom I meet here for the first time, avail thyself of this happy hour and of the stillness around us, and above us, and let me tell thee something of the thought which has suddenly risen before me like a star which would fain shed down its rays upon thee and every one, as befits the nature of light

And then you will find every pain and every pleasure, every friend and every enemy, every hope and every error, every blade of grass and every ray of sunshine once more, and the whole fabric of things which make up your life

In ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' (1888), he wrote that he thought of the eternal return as the "fundamental conception" of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''.<ref>Nietzsche, [[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]], "Why I Write Such Good Books", "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", §1</ref>

However the example presupposes the possibility of perfect continuity: for instance, if the universe proves to have a [[quantum foam]] nature, then the exact quantity of an irrational number cannot be expressed by any physical object.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

 Hence Camus famously concludes that, "one must imagine Sisyphus happy."

== Opposing argument ==

Nietzsche scholar [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] has described an argument originally put forward by [[Georg Simmel]], which rebuts the claim that a finite number of states must repeat within an infinite amount of time:
<blockquote>
Even if there were exceedingly few things in a finite space in an infinite time, they would not have to repeat in the same configurations

 According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the ''question'' of eternal recurrence—whether or not such a thing could possibly be true—that is so significant in modern thought: "The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [of eternal recurrence] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' is at the same time 'the most burdensome thought.'
