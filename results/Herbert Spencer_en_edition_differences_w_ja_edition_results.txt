Herbert Spencer
en edition's differences with the ja version: 
-2.69392e-09
The psychological – and hence also the moral – constitution which had been bequeathed to the present generation by our ancestors, and which we in turn would hand on to future generations, was in the process of gradual adaptation to the requirements of living in society
-1.8618e-10
In the perfect society individuals would not only derive pleasure from the exercise of altruism ('positive beneficence') but would aim to avoid inflicting pain on others ('negative beneficence')
-8.43769e-11
As [[William James]] remarked, Spencer "enlarged the imagination, and set free the speculative mind of countless doctors, engineers, and lawyers, of many physicists and chemists, and of thoughtful laymen generally."<ref>James, William

By the 1880s he was denouncing "the new [[Tory|Toryism]]" (that is, the "social reformist wing" of the Liberal party – the wing to some extent hostile to Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]], this faction of the Liberal party Spencer compared to the interventionist "[[Toryism]]" of such people as the former Conservative party Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]])
-1.5639e-11
In ''[[The Man vs the state|The Man versus the State]]'' (1884),<ref>[http://www.constitution.org/hs/manvssta.htm The Man vs the State, 1884] at the Constitution Society</ref> he attacked Gladstone and the Liberal party for losing its proper mission (they should be defending personal liberty, he said) and instead promoting paternalist social legislation (what Gladstone himself called "Construction" – an element in the modern Liberal party that he opposed)
-1.38698e-11
Although often dismissed as a lightweight forerunner of Charles Darwin's ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', Chambers' book was in reality a programme for the unification of science which aimed to show that [[Laplace]]'s [[nebular hypothesis]] for the origin of the solar system and Lamarck's theory of species transformation were both instances (in Lewes' phrase) of 'one magnificent generalisation of progressive development.' Chambers was associated with Chapman's salon and his work served as the unacknowledged template for the Synthetic Philosophy
-2.72848e-12
A comparison can be made of such state with [[Thermodynamic equilibrium]], a state with no net macroscopic flows of matter or of energy
-9.01501e-14
He came to predict that social welfare programmes would eventually lead to socialisation of the means of production, saying "all socialism is slavery"; Spencer defined a slave as a person who "labours under coercion to satisfy another's desires" and believed that under socialism or communism the individual would be enslaved to the whole community rather than to a particular master, and "it means not whether his master is a single person or society"
1.23279e-12
246.</ref> Spencer argued that the state was not an "essential" institution and that it would "decay" as voluntary market organisation would replace the coercive aspects of the state.<ref>Stringham, Edward
2.14229e-12
Over the course of many generations the evolutionary process would ensure that human beings would become less aggressive and increasingly altruistic, leading eventually to a perfect society in which no one would cause another person pain
1.38698e-11

Spencer followed Comte in aiming for the unification of scientific truth; it was in this sense that his philosophy aimed to be 'synthetic.' Like Comte, he was committed to the universality of natural law, the idea that the laws of nature applied without exception, to the organic realm as much as to the inorganic, and to the human mind as much as to the rest of creation
1.77351e-11
The expression '[[There is no alternative]]' (TINA), made famous by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]], may be traced to its emphatic use by Spencer.<ref>''Social Statics'' (1851), pp
1.93978e-11
In this respect, he followed the model laid down by the Edinburgh publisher [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]] in his anonymous ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'' (1844)

Members included physicist-philosopher [[John Tyndall]] and Darwin's cousin, the banker and biologist [[Sir John Lubbock]]

Whereas ''Social Statics'' had been the work of a radical democrat who believed in votes for women (and even for children) and in the nationalisation of the land to break the power of the aristocracy, by the 1880s he had become a staunch opponent of female suffrage and made common cause with the landowners of the [[Liberty and Property Defence League]] against what they saw as the drift towards 'socialism' of elements (such as Sir [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]]) within the administration of [[William Ewart Gladstone]] – largely against the opinions of Gladstone himself
1.22441e-10
As his American follower [[John Fiske (philosopher)|John Fiske]] observed, Spencer's ideas were to be found "running like the weft through all the warp" of Victorian thought.<ref>Quoted in John Offer, ''Herbert Spencer: Critical Assessments'' (London: Routledge, 2004), p

Its publisher, [[John Chapman (publisher)|John Chapman]], introduced Spencer to his salon which was attended by many of the leading radical and progressive thinkers of the capital, including [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Harriet Martineau]], [[George Henry Lewes]] and Mary Ann Evans ([[George Eliot]]), with whom he was briefly romantically linked
1.25783e-09
537</ref> In common with others of his generation, including the members of Chapman's salon, he was possessed with the idea of demonstrating that it was possible to show that everything in the universe – including human culture, language, and morality – could be explained by laws of universal validity
1.25783e-09

Spencer adopted a [[utilitarian]] standard of ultimate value – the greatest happiness of the greatest number – and the culmination of the evolutionary process would be the maximization of utility

</ref> The alleged contradiction between Spencer's theory and the second law of thermodynamics might arise from limiting the definition of homogeneity and heterogeneity to the homogeneity and heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of matter

In contrast to Comte, who stressed only the unity of scientific method, Spencer sought the unification of scientific knowledge in the form of the reduction of all natural laws to one fundamental law, the law of evolution

It was a universal law, that was applying to the stars and the galaxies as much as to biological organisms, and to human social organisation as much as to the human mind

Moreover, industrial society was the direct descendant of the ideal society developed in ''Social Statics'', although Spencer now equivocated over whether the evolution of society would result in [[anarchism]] (as he had first believed) or whether it pointed to a continued role for the state, albeit one reduced to the minimal functions of the enforcement of contracts and external defence

==Evolution==
Spencer first articulated his evolutionary perspective in his essay, 'Progress: Its Law and Cause', published in Chapman's ''[[Westminster Review]]'' in 1857, and which later formed the basis of the ''First Principles of a New System of Philosophy'' (1862)

His main objections were threefold: the use of the coercive powers of [[Government of the United Kingdom|the government]], the discouragement given to voluntary self-improvement, and the disregard of the "laws of life." The reforms, he said, were tantamount to "socialism", which he said was about the same as "slavery" in terms of limiting human freedom

In it he expounded a theory of evolution which combined insights from [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s essay 'The Theory of Life' – itself derivative from [[Friedrich von Schelling]]'s [[Naturphilosophie]] – with a generalisation of [[Karl Ernst von Baer|von Baer]]'s law of embryological development

Though Spencer made some valuable contributions to early sociology, not least in his influence on [[structural functionalism]], his attempt to introduce Lamarckian or Darwinian ideas into the realm of sociology was unsuccessful

However, Spencer's theories of laissez-faire, survival-of-the-fittest and minimal human interference in the processes of natural law had an enduring and even increasing appeal in the social science fields of economics and political science, and one writer has recently made the case for Spencer's importance for a sociology that must learn to take energy in society seriously.<ref>McKinnon, AM

Through this paradigm, Spencer aimed to reconcile the [[associationist psychology]] of Mill's ''Logic'', the notion that human mind was constructed from atomic sensations held together by the laws of the association of ideas, with the apparently more 'scientific' theory of [[phrenology]], which located specific mental functions in specific parts of the brain.<ref>In 1844, Spencer published three articles on phrenology in [[The Zoist|The Zoist: A Journal of Cerebral Physiology & Mesmerism, and Their Applications to Human Welfare]]: "''A New View of the Functions of Imitation and Benevolence''" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=RuNXAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA369#v=onepage Vol.1, No.4, (January 1844), pp

While often caricatured as ultra-conservative, Spencer had been more radical earlier in his career – opposing private property in land and claiming that each person has a latent claim to participate in the use of the earth (views that influenced [[Georgism]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S450.htm|title=Herbert Spencer on the Land Question: A Criticism, by Alfred Russel Wallace|website=people.wku.edu}}</ref> calling himself "a [[radical feminist]]" and advocating the organisation of trade unions as a bulwark against "exploitation by bosses", and favoured an economy organised primarily in free worker co-operatives as a replacement for wage-labor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://radgeek.com/gt/2008/04/02/herbert_spencer/,%20https://radgeek.com/gt/2008/04/02/herbert_spencer/|title=Herbert Spencer Anti-Defamation League (Part 423 of ???)}}</ref> Although he retained support for unions, his views on the other issues had changed by the 1880s

In a letter to the Japanese government regarding intermarriage with Westerners, Spencer stated that "if you mix the constitution of two widely divergent varieties which have severally become adapted to widely divergent modes of life, you get a constitution which is adapted to the mode of life of neither—a constitution which will not work properly"
