Geography of Egypt

en edition's differences with the ru version: 


1. 
[[Archaeological]] research indicates that people once lived at a much higher elevation along the river than they do today, probably because the river was higher or the floods more severe. 

2. 
 It is largely below sea level and is {{convert|133|m|ft|0|sp=us}} below sea level at the lowest. 

3. 
The Red Sea may have been named after these mountains, which are red. 

4. 

The region's most prominent feature is the easterly chain of rugged mountains, the [[Red Sea Hills]], which extend from the Nile Valley eastward to the [[Gulf of Suez]] and the Red Sea. 

5. 
Similar to the desert, the peninsula contains mountains in its southern sector that are a geological extension of the Red Sea Hills, the low range along the Red Sea coast that includes [[Mount Catherine]] (Jabal Katrinah), the country's highest point, at 2,642 m above sea-level. 

6. 

[[Egypt]] has coastlines on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[River Nile]], and the [[Red Sea]]. 

7. 

* Northernmost point – unnamed headland immediately north-west of [[Sidi Barrani]], [[Matruh Governorate]]
* Easternmost point – [[Ras Hadarba]] (Cape Elba), [[Red Sea Governorate]]*
* Southernmost point - [[Jabal Bartazuga]] on the Sudanese border, [[Red Sea Governorate]] **
* Westernmost point - unnamed point on the border with [[Libya]] immediately east of the ruin of [[Qasr al Qarn]] in Libya, [[Matruh Governorate]]
* ''* Ras Hadarba lies within the [[Hala'ib triangle]] which is claimed by [[Sudan]] but occupied by Egypt. 

8. 
Lake Nasser, the world's largest artificial lake, has enabled planned use of the Nile regardless of the amount of rainfall in [[Central Africa]] and [[East Africa]]. 

9. 
The dams have also affected the Nile Valley's [[fertility]], which was dependent for centuries not only on the water brought to the [[arable land]] but also on the materials left by the water. 

10. 
North Sinai has its capital at Al Arish and the South Sinai has its capital in Artt Turkishy. 

11. 
If it is excluded, then Egypt's easternmost point is the [[Ras Banas]] [[peninsula]] on the mainland or, including islands, [[Mukawwa Island]]''
* ''** Egypt's southernmost point lies in the [[Bir Tawil]] region, an area that is commonly included as part of Egypt but is not claimed by it. 

12. 

===Sinai Peninsula===
[[File:Katharinenkloster Sinai BW 2.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Mount Catherine]] in [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], Egypt's highest point.]]
The [[Sinai Peninsula]] is a triangular-shaped [[peninsula]], about 61,100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in area (slightly smaller than the [[U.S. 

13. 
For several kilometres north of Khartoum, water closer to the eastern bank of the river, coming from the Blue Nile, is visibly [[mud]]dy, while that closer to the western bank, and coming from the White Nile, is clearer. 

14. 
 The agricultural industry is dependent on [[irrigation]] from the Nile river.<ref>{{cite book |title=Directions of Change in Rural Egypt |author=Hopkins, Nicholas and Kirsten Westergaard |year=1998 |publisher=American University in Cairo |pages=2–4}}</ref>

==Extreme points==
This is a list of the extreme points of [[Egypt]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location. 

15. 

===Western Desert===
{{Main|Western Desert (Egypt)}}
The Western Desert covers an area of some 700,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, thereby  accounting for around two-thirds of Egypt's total land area. 

16. 
 Steep rocky cliffs rise along the banks of the Nile in some stretches, while other areas along the Nile are flat, with space for agricultural production.

{{Coord|27|00|N|30|00|E|type:country|display=title}}
The '''geography of Egypt''' relates to two regions: [[North Africa]] and [[Southwest Asia]]. 

18. 

==Governorates==
{{Main|Governorates of Egypt}}
Egypt is divided into 28 [[governorate]]s, which include two city-governorates: [[Alexandria]] ([[Alexandria Governorate]]) and [[Cairo]] ([[Cairo Governorate]]). 

19. 
The length within Egypt of the River Nile in its northwards course from three central African sources – the [[White Nile]], the [[Blue Nile]], and the [[Atbara]] – totals some 1,600&nbsp;km. 

20. 

===Eastern Desert===

{{Main|Eastern Desert}}

The topographic features of the desert region east of the Nile differ from those to the west of the Nile. 

21. 
Unlike the White Nile, the Blue Nile carries a considerable amount of [[sediment]]. 

22. 
Thus, before the [[Aswan High Dam]] was completed in 1971, the White Nile watered the Egyptian stretch of the river throughout the year, whereas the Blue Nile, carrying seasonal rain from Ethiopia, caused the Nile to overflow its banks and deposit a layer of fertile mud over adjacent fields.
