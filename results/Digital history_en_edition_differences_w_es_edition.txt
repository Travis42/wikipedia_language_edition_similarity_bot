How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

Digital history

en edition's differences with the es version: 


1. 
Textual analysis software allows historians to "text mine", or easily find correlations and themes in the documents.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} There are several textual-analysis programs available online, from sophisticated ones that allow the researcher to tailor the program to handle large amounts of data, like MALLET,<ref>http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/</ref> and straightforward programs like TokenX,<ref>http://tokenx.unl.edu/</ref> which generates word-frequency lists and word clouds to illustrate language usage and significance, to basic ones like Wordle,<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20110529082541/http://www.wordle.net/</ref> which offers simple visualizations of word frequency and relationships. 

2. 
* Create models and maps of data extracted to create a visualisation of the data. 

3. 
Recent digital history projects focus on creativity, collaboration, and technical innovation, [[text mining]], [[corpus linguistics]], [[Social network analysis|network analysis]], [[3D modeling]], and [[big data]] analysis. 

4. 
The project collected data related to Augusta County in [[Virginia]] and Franklin County in [[Pennsylvania]] during the [[American Civil War]]. 

5. 
''Historians Guide to Statistics'' (1971), with detailed guide to older studies
* Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski. 

6. 
By the late 1970s younger historians turned to cultural studies, but the outpouring of quantitive studies by established scholars continued. 

7. 
In the class, students are encouraged to apply both traditional history methods and digital methods to a semester-long project of their choosing. 

8. 
Another significant project is the Old Bailey Online,a digital collection of all proceedings between 1674 and 1913.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/|title=Old Bailey Online - The Proceedings of the Old Bailey, 1674-1913 - Central Criminal Court|website=www.oldbaileyonline.org|access-date=2016-04-28}}</ref> In addition to the digitized records, the Old Bailey Online website provides historical and legal background information, research guides,and educational resources for students. 

9. 
Coding languages such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]] may be used in order to digitally sort and filter data, whilst [[Google Fusion Tables]] can be used for the geographical mapping of data. 

10. 
Together, they produced an online article entitled "The Differences Slavery Made: A Close Analysis of Two American Communities," which also appeared in the ''American Historical Review'' in 2003.<ref>http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/AHR/</ref> A CD-ROM also accompanied the Valley Project, published by [[W.

''Past Time, Past Place: GIS for History''.

These early computers could be programmed to conduct statistical analyses of these records, creating tallies, or seeking trends across records.<ref>Charles Dollar and Richard Jensen, ''Historians Guide to Statistics'' (1971)</ref> This research into historical demography was rooted in the rise of [[social history]] as a field of historical interest. 

14. 
Some of these applications include:
* Combining traditional historical methods and new research methods in order to come to new conclusions. 

15. 
Robert Darnton's 2000 article, "An Early Information Society: News and the Media in Eighteenth-Century Paris" was supplemented with electronic resources and is an early model of the discussions around digital history and its future in the humanities.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Darnton |first=Robert |title=An Early Information Society: News and the Media in Eighteenth-Century Paris |journal=American Historical Review |volume=5 |issue=1 |year=2000 |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/105.1/ah000001.html |accessdate=2008-03-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217185549/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/105.1/ah000001.html |archivedate=2007-12-17 }}</ref> One of the first major digital projects to be reviewed by the American Historical Review (AHR) was Philip Ethington's "Los Angeles and the Problem of Urban Historical Knowledge"<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20110906051946/http://cwis.usc.edu/dept/LAS/history/historylab/LAPUHK/index.html</ref>—a multimedia exploration of changes to Los Angeles' physical profile over the course of several decades.

== Technology ==

Digital technology tools arrange ideas and promote the unique analysis of data, with many tools previously unavailable to historians opening new avenues for collaboration, text mining, and [[big data]] analysis. 

17. 
In each of these projects, mediated archives holding multiple types of sources are combined with digital tools to analyze and illuminate an historical question to a varying degree; this integration of content and tools with analysis is one of the hallmarks of digital history—projects move beyond archives or collections and into scholarly analysis and the use of digital tools to develop that analysis.
