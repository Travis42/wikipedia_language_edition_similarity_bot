Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.

The debate between theorists A and theorists B is a continuation of a metaphysical dispute that dates back to the ancient Greek philosophers [[Heráclito]] and [[Elea's Parménides] Parmenides]]. 

3. 

Theory B is often based on [theoretical physics] researchers such as [Brian Greene], <ref> "Brian Greene on the B-theory of time" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1WfFkp4puw</ref> and on theories such as [eternalism].

Theory B in metaphysics
The difference between theorists A and Theorists B is often described as a dispute over the time step or the "becoming" and the "progress".

For example, the spinning disc argument asks the reader to imagine a world that contains nothing more than a homogeneous rotating disc.

This is demonstrated in the [[ Rietdijk Argument – Putnam-argument Rietdijk – Putnam]] and, in addition, in an advanced form of this argument called the [[ Andromeda Paradox,] created by the mathematical physicist [Roger Penrose].] <ref>[Roger Penrose] Penrose, R.]] (1989).

The statement "I am not pronouncing anything simultaneouswith this statement" is contradictory and cannot be true even when one thinks of the statement.

A piece of chalk can be divided into two physical halves, but it seems absurd to talk about dividing it into two temporal halves.

Prior asks the reader to imagine having a headache, and after the headache subsides, he says "thank God it's over." Prior argues that theory B cannot make sense of this sentence.

Endurantism and endurantism
Opponents also accuse theory B of not being able to explain the persistence of objects.

Therefore, it is common (though not universal) for B theorists to be [[Quadrintertive's],—that is, to believe that objects extend both in time and in space and therefore have temporal and spatial parts.

Opposition
In "'Presentism and the Space-Time Manifold''," [[Dean Zimmerman]] notes that theory A is "almost certainly a minority vision among philosophers", while theory B has "achieved broad acceptance"; Despite this, there are still several philosophers who maintain opposition to the theory B.

An object is defined as a collection of space-time parts, which are defined as parts of a durable object.

Theorists B argue that the fact that we know much less about the future simply reflects a difference [[Epistemology]] between the future and the past: the future is no less real than the past; we only know less about it.

The Irreducibility of Time
Previously, theorists B argued that one could paraphrase tense sentences (such as "the sun now shines") in stressless sentences (such as "September 28, the sun shines") without losing the meaning.
