However, Plato does seem influenced by Heraclitus in his concept of the world as always changing, and thus our inability to have knowledge of [[Particular|particulars]], and by Parmenides in needing another world, the Platonic realm, where things remain unchanging and [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] exist as the objects of knowledge, the [[Theory of forms|Forms]].

 The earliest surviving Stoic work, the ''Hymn to Zeus'' of [[Cleanthes]], a work transitional from pagan polytheism to the modern religions and philosophies, though not explicitly referencing Heraclitus, adopts what appears to be the Heraclitean logos modified.{{efn|Different translations of this can be found at {{cite web |first=T.W.

According to Diogenes Laërtius: "Finally, he became a hater of his kind (''misanthrope'') and wandered the mountains [...] making his diet of grass and herbs."

=== Childhood ===
Diogenes Laërtius says that Heraclitus used to play [[knucklebones]] with the youths in the great temple of [[Artemis]], the [[Temple of Artemis|Artemisium]], one of the largest temples of the 6th century BC and one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].{{efn|Ancient temples were regularly used for storing treasures, and were open to private individuals under exceptional circumstances.}} When asked to start making laws he refused saying that the constitution (''politeia'') was ''ponêra'',<ref name="ix2">[[Diogenes Laërtius]], ix. 

27. 

====''Hodos ano kato'', "the way up and the way down"====
Heraclitus also said "The way up and the way down is one and the same."<ref>DK B60, from Hippolytus, ''Refutation of All Heresies'' 9.10.4</ref> Similarly he said "In writing, the course taken, straight and crooked, is one and the same."<ref>DK B59, from Hippolytus ''Refutation of All Heresies'' 9.10.4</ref> This can be interpreted in various ways. 

28. 
}}
In a [[metaphor]] and one of the earliest uses of a [[force]] in the history of philosophy, Heraclitus compares the union of opposites to a strung bow or lyre held in shape by an equilibrium of the string [[Tension (physics)|tension]]:<ref>DK B51, from Hippolytus, ''Refutation of All Heresies'' 9.9.2</ref><blockquote>There is a harmony in the bending back ({{lang|grc|παλίντροπος}} ''palintropos'') as in the case of the bow and the lyre.</blockquote>

He claims this shows something true yet invisible about reality; "a hidden harmony is better than an apparent one."<ref>DK B54, from Hippolytus, ''Refutation of All Heresies'' 9.9.5</ref> He also noted "the bow's name is life, though its work is death,"<ref>DK B48, from Etymologium Magnum sv bios</ref> a play on both bow and life being the same word as written - biós; further evidence of a continuous, written work.

=====War=====
[[File:Greek Phalanx.jpg|thumb|340px|War is the father of all and the king of all.]]
Heraclitus is the original philosopher to claim that [[war]] is a good thing. 

34. 
 He was most famous for his insistence on ever-present [[Change (philosophy)|change]], or flux or [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]], as the characteristic feature of the world, as stated in the famous saying, "No man ever steps in the same [[river]] twice" as well as "Panta rhei," everything flows.

<blockquote>Cold things become warm, and what is warm cools; what is wet dries, and the parched is moistened.<ref>DK B126, from John Tzetzes ''Notes on the Iliad'' p. 

36. 
A soul should therefore aim toward becoming more full of fire and less full of water: a "dry" soul was best.<ref>DK B118, from Stobaeus ''Selections'' 3.5.8</ref> According to Heraclitus, worldly pleasures ([[Alcohol intoxication|drinking]] most apparently<ref>DK B117, from Plotinus ''Enneads'' 4.8.1</ref>) made the soul "moist", and he considered mastering one's worldly desires to be a noble pursuit which purified the soul's fire.<ref name="russell">[[Bertrand Russell|Russell, Bertrand]], ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]''</ref> The soul also has a self-increasing ''Logos''.<ref>DK B115, from Stobaeus ''Selectiosn'' 3.1.180</ref> He believed we breathe in the ''logos'', as Anaximenes would say of air and the soul.<ref name="guth46" /> He also stated "It is hard to fight with one's heart's desire. 

37. 
 

Diogenes Laërtius also states that Heraclitus' work was "a continuous treatise...but was divided into three discourses, one on the universe, another on politics, and a third on theology." He does not say whether Heraclitus divided them this way or someone else did.<ref name=stanf/> [[Theophrastus]] says (in Diogenes Laërtius) "...some parts of his work [are] half-finished, while other parts [made] a strange medley."<ref name="ix6" />

Burnet does not think the work had a title:<blockquote>"We do not know the title of the work of Herakleitos.—if, indeed, it had one— and it is not easy to form a clear idea of its contents. 

38. 
However, he removes the human sense of justice from his concept of God: "To God all things are fair and good and just, but people hold some things wrong and some right."<ref>DK B102, from Porphyry, ''Notes on Homer'', on Iliad 4.4</ref>  
===== Mysticism =====
God's custom has wisdom but human custom does not.<ref>DK B78, from Origen, ''Against Celsus'' 6.12</ref> Wisdom is "to know the thought by which all things are steered through all things",<ref>DK B41, from Laertius, ''Lives'', 9.1</ref> which must not imply that people are or can be wise. 

39. 
He says: " For that which is made up of both the opposites is one; and, when the one is divided, the opposites are disclosed. 

40. 
===The "weeping philosopher"===
A later tradition referred to Heraclitus as the "weeping philosopher", as opposed to [[Democritus]], who is known as the "laughing philosopher".<ref>{{cite book |last=Seneca |first=Lucius Annaeus |authorlink=Seneca the younger |translator1=John M.

===== Monism =====
One interpretation is that it shows his [[monism]], though perhaps a [[dialectical monism|dialectical]] one. 

42. 
McTaggart]]'s illustration of the [[A series and B series|A-series and B-series]] of time has been seen as an analogous application to time of Heraclitus and Parmenides views of all of reality, respectively. 

43. 
" Nothing ever is, everything is becoming ”; " All things are in motion like streams ”; "All things are passing, and nothing abides ”; " Herakleitos says somewhere that all things pass and naught abides; and, comparing things to the current of a river, he says you cannot step twicw into the same stream ” (cf.

{{ISBN|0521136679}}</ref>

With regard to education, Diogenes Laërtius says that Heraclitus was "wondrous" from childhood.{{efn|''thaumasios'', which, as [[Socrates]] explains in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' and ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', is the beginning of philosophy}} Diogenes relates that [[Sotion]] said he was a "hearer" of [[Xenophanes]], which contradicts Heraclitus' statement (so says Diogenes Laërtius) that he had taught himself by questioning himself.

<blockquote></blockquote>

Simplicius references it thus:<blockquote>"...the natural philosophers who follow Heraclitus, keeping in view the perpetual flux of generation and the fact that all corporeal things are coming to be and departing and never really are (as [[Timaeus of Locri|Timaeus]] said too) claim that all things are always in flux and that you could not step twice in the same river."<ref>Barnes (1982), p.

Diogenes Laërtius has a quote summing up Heraclitus's philosophy: "All things come into being by conflict of opposites, and the sum of things ({{lang|grc|τὰ ὅλα}} ''ta hola'', "the whole") flows like a stream."<ref name="DLix8">Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 

47. 
In his First Apology, he said both Socrates and Heraclitus were Christians before Christ: "those who lived reasonably are Christians, even though they have been thought atheists; as, among the Greeks, Socrates and Heraclitus, and men like them." <ref>{{cite web |last=Martyr |first=Justin |title=First Apology of Justin |publisher=Early Christian Writings |url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-firstapology.html}}</ref>

The weeping philosopher was still considered an indispensable motif for philosophy through the modern period. 

48. 

==== God ====
Heraclitus distinguishes between human laws and divine law ({{lang|grc|τοῦ θείου}} {{transl|grc|toū theiou}} {{Literal translation|"of God"|lk=on}}).<ref>DK B114, from Stobaeus ''Selections'' 3.1.179</ref> He said both God and fire are "want and surfeit".<ref>DK B65, from Hippolytus ''Refutation of All Heresies'' 9.10.7</ref>  In addition to seeing fire as the most fundamental substance, he presents fire as the divine cosmos.

====The River====
[[File:K%C3%BC%C3%A7%C3%BCk_Menderes_1.png|thumb|300px|No man ever steps in the same river twice.]]
His philosophy has been summed up with another famous adage, "No man ever steps in the same river twice."<ref>DK B91, from Plutarch ''On the E at Delphi'' 392b</ref> It can be contrasted with Parmenides's statement that "whatever is, is, and what is not cannot be." Heraclitus uses the river image more than once:

<blockquote>Ever-newer waters flow on those who step into the same rivers.<ref>DK B12, from Arius Didymus, fr.

Plato knew of Heraclitus through Cratylus, and thus wrote his dialogue of the same name.<ref>Metaphysics, 987a32</ref>  Plato thought the views of Heraclitus entailed that no entity may ever occupy a single state at a single time, and argued against him as follows:<ref>[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]] Paragraph 440 sections c-d.</ref><blockquote>How can that be a real thing which is never in the same state.

He criticizes [[Hesiod]], Pythagoras, [[Xenophanes]], and [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]] as lacking understanding though learned,<ref name=":2" /> and has the most scorn for Pythagoras.<ref name="b129" />  Though he grants, "Men that love wisdom must be inquirers into very many things indeed;"<ref>DK B35, from Clement ''Miscellanies '' 5.140.5</ref> he said that "The knowledge of the most famous persons, which they guard, is but opinion."<ref>DK B28, from Clement ''Miscellanies'' 5.9.3</ref> 

He also thought that [[Homer]] and [[Archilochus]] deserved to be beaten.<ref>DK B42, from Laertius, ''Lives'', 9.1</ref> The only man of note he praises is [[Bias of Priene]], one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]], whose famous maxim is "most men are bad."<ref>DK B39, Laertius, ''Lives'', 1.88</ref>  "For what thought or wisdom have they.

====''Dike eris'',<!--nominative of "diken erin" (Β80)--> "strife is justice" ====
In this union of opposites,  of both generation and destruction, Heraclitus called the oppositional processes {{lang|grc|ἔρις}} ({{transl|grc|eris}}), "[[Eris (mythology)|strife]]", and hypothesizes that the apparently stable state, {{lang|grc|δίκη}} ({{transl|grc|dikê}}), or "[[Dike (mythology)|justice]]", is a [[Harmonia (mythology)|harmony]] of it.<ref name=dkb8/> Anaximander described the same as injustice.<ref name="wkcg" /> Aristotle mentions that Heraclitus disliked Homer because he wished strife would leave the world, which for Heraclitus would destroy the world; "there would be no harmony without high and low notes, and no animals without male and female, which are opposites."<ref>Eudemian Ethics 1235a25</ref>
On the unity of opposites, Burnet says:<blockquote>"The " strife of opposites " is really an “ attunement ” (armonia). 

61. 


=== The One and the Many ===
On Heraclitus' teachings of the one and many, Burnet writes: <blockquote>"The truth Herakleitos proclaimed was that the world is at once one and many, and that it is just the “ opposite tension ” of the opposites that constitutes the unity of the One. 

62. 
He wanted not merely something from which opposites could be “ separated out,” but something which of its own nature would pass into everything else, while everything else would pass in turn into it.

====''Panta rhei'', "everything flows"<!--'Panta rhei (Heraclitus)' redirects here--> ====

Heraclitus does seem to say change is what unites things, as with his unity of opposites, or the quote "Even the ''[[kykeon]]'' falls apart if it is not stirred."<ref>B125, from Theophrastus ''On Vertigo'' 9</ref> and "Changing it rests."<ref>Plotnius, ''Enneads'' 4.8.1</ref>

====The Sun====
[[File:Sunrise_in_Kumkuyu,_Mersin_2009-07-22_01-4.jpg|thumb|300px|The Sun is new every day.]]
Flux is also expressed by the fact that, rather than thinking the same Sun will rise tomorrow as rose today, Heraclitus said the Sun is new every day.<ref>DK B6, from Aristotle ''Meteorology'' 2.2 355a13</ref>

=== God and the Soul ===
By "God" Heraclitus does not mean the Christian version of a single God as ''[[primum movens]]'' of all things, God as Creator, for the universe is eternal, "it always was and will be;" but the divine as opposed to human; the immortal as opposed to the mortal, the cyclical as opposed to the transient.

 He's been seen variously as a "[[Material monism|material monist]] or a [[process philosophy|process philosopher]]; a scientific [[cosmologist]], a [[Metaphysics|metaphysician]], or mainly a [[Religion|religious]] thinker; an [[empiricism|empiricist]], a [[rationalism|rationalist]], or a [[mysticism|mystic]]; a conventional thinker or a revolutionary; a developer of [[logic]] or one who [[dialetheism|denied]] the [[law of non-contradiction]]; the first genuine philosopher or an anti-intellectual obscurantist."<ref name=stanf>https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heraclitus/</ref>    

He was of distinguished parentage but eschewed his privileged life for a lonely one as a philosopher.

The first quote is the earliest use of ''[[cosmos|kosmos]]'' in any extant Greek text.<ref name=stanf/>

On Heraclitus using Fire as a new primary substance, Burnet writes:<blockquote>"All this made it necessary for him to seek out a new primary substance. 

71. 

====Parmenides====
[[File:Parmenides.jpg|thumb|200px|Parmenides may have been responding to Heraclitus.]]
Parmenides's proem argues that change is impossible, and may very well have been referring to Heraclitus with such passages as "Undiscerning crowds, who hold that it is and is not the same, and all things travel in opposite directions!". 

72. 
In ''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]'', one of the best sources on quotes from Heraclitus, Hippolytus says: "What the blasphemous folly is of [[Noetus]], and that he devoted himself to the tenets of Heraclitus the Obscure, not to those of Christ."<ref>Book IX leading sentence.</ref> Hippolytus then goes on to present an inscrutable quote: "God (''theos'') is day and night, winter and summer, ... 

73. 
Heraclitus is silent on Parmenides, yet Parmenides seems possibly to refer to him, and Heraclitus refers to the likes of [[Pythagoras]].<ref name=":2">DK B40, from Laertius, ''Lives'' 9.1</ref><ref name=b129>DK B129</ref> 
====Diogenes Laërtius====

The main source for the life of Heraclitus is the notable doxographer [[Diogenes Laërtius]], although some have questioned the validity of his account as "a tissue of [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] anecdotes, most of them obviously fabricated on the basis of statements in the preserved fragments".<ref name="kahn">{{cite book |last=Kahn |first=Charles |title=The Art and Thought of Heraclitus: Fragments with Translation and Commentary |location=London |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1979 |pages=1–23 |isbn=978-0-521-28645-9}}</ref> It also seems the stories about Heraclitus could be invented to illustrate his character as inferred from his writings.<ref name=stanf/>

Diogenes Laërtius said that Heraclitus [[floruit|flourished]] in the 69th [[Olympiad]], 504–501 BC.<ref name="ix1">Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 

74. 
Scholars have generally believed that either Parmenides was responding to Heraclitus, or Heraclitus to Parmenides, though opinion on who was responding to whom has varied over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries.<ref name="Palmer">{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parmenides|title=Parmenides|author=John Palmer|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|year=2016}}</ref> Most figure Parmenides was responding to Heraclitus, and therefore Heraclitus was the older of the two. 

75. 
He cannot accuse Heraclitus of being a heretic so he says instead: "Did not (Heraclitus) the Obscure anticipate Noetus in framing a system ...?" The apparent pantheist deity of Heraclitus (if that is what the fragment means) must be equal to the union of opposites and therefore must be corporeal and incorporeal, divine and not-divine, dead and alive, etc., and the [[Trinity]] can only be reached by some sort of illusory shape-shifting.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hippolytus |title=Refutation of All Heresies |pages=Book IX Chapter 5 |publisher=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/050109.htm |accessdate=2007-12-01}}</ref>

Heraclitus also stated "human opinions are children's toys."<ref>DK B70, from Stobaeus, ''Selections'' 2.1.16</ref> However, "Man is called a baby by God, even as a child [is called a baby] by a man."<ref>DK B79</ref> Heraclitus also states "We should not act and speak like 'children of our parents", interpreted by [[Marcus Aurelius]] to mean not simply accept what others believe.<ref>DK B74, from Marcus Aurelius, ''Meditations''</ref>

He regarded the soul as being a mixture of fire and water, with fire being the noble part of the soul, and water the ignoble part.

Dall'Orto.JPG|thumb|220px| But it always was and will be: an ever-living fire.]]
Like the previous [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Milesians]], [[Thales of Miletus|Thales]] with water and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] with air, Heraclitus considered fire as the [[arche]], the most fundamental element, which gave rise to the other elements, perhaps because living people are warm.<ref name="Weinstein-Greece" /> [[Norman Melchert]] interpreted Heraclitus as using "fire" metaphorically, in lieu of ''Logos'', as the origin of all things.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Great Conversation|last=Melchert|first=Norman|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-19-530682-8|edition=5th}}</ref> Others see it as a metaphor for change, like a dancing and flickering flame, or perhaps all of these. 

79. 
Says [[Charles Kahn|Kahn]]: "Down to the time of [[Plutarch]] and [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]], if not later, the little book of Heraclitus was available in its original form to any reader who chose to seek it out."<ref name="kahn" /> Diogenes Laërtius says: "the book acquired such fame that it produced partisans of his philosophy who were called [[Ephesian School|Heracliteans]]."<ref name="ix6" /> [[Cratylus]] was one such follower.

The sense of smell also seemed to play a role in his philosophy.

===Logos===
{{Main|Logos}}
The meaning of ''Logos'' is subject to interpretation: "word", "account", "principle", "plan", "formula", "measure", "proportion", "reckoning."<ref>For the etymology see {{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE267.html|title=Appendix I: Indo-European Roots: leg-|last=Watkins|first=Calvert|year=2000|publisher=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition}}</ref> Though Heraclitus "quite deliberately plays on the various meanings of ''logos''",<ref>K.F. 

83. 
Diogenes Laërtius lists various stories about Heraclitus' death: In two versions, Heraclitus was cured of the dropsy and died of another disease. 

84. 
According to him, "the origin of philosophy is to be dated from Heraclitus." He attributes dialectics to Heraclitus rather than, as Aristotle did, to Zeno of Elea. 

85. 
 In the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' Aristotle mentions how some say Heraclitus denied the [[law of noncontradiction]], and accuses him of not reasoning.<ref>Metaphysics Book 4, section 1005b</ref>  According to Diogenes Laërtius, Timon of Phlius called him "the Riddler" ({{lang|grc|αἰνικτής}}; {{transl|grc|ainiktēs}}), and  explained that Heraclitus wrote his book "rather unclearly" (''asaphesteron'') so that only the "capable" should attempt it.<ref name="ix6" /> Heraclitus himself wrote "The lord whose is the [[oracle at Delphi]] neither speaks nor hides his [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]], but gives a [[sign]]."<ref>DK B93, from Plutarch ''On the Pythian Oracle'' 404D</ref>[[File:Heraclitus_of_Ephesius,_Ionian_philosopher,_at_Ephesus._Wellcome_L0002557.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Heraclitus]]
By the time of [[Cicero]] he had become "the dark" ({{lang|grc|ὁ Σκοτεινός}}; {{transl|grc|ho Skoteinós}}) because he had spoken ''nimis obscurē'', "too obscurely", concerning nature and had done so deliberately in order to be misunderstood.<ref>''De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum'', Chapter 2, Section 15.</ref> The customary English translation of {{lang|grc|ὁ Σκοτεινός}} follows the Latin, "the Obscure".

==Philosophy == 
Heraclitus's philosophy of change is commonly called [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]], and can be seen in a [[Dialectic|dialectical]] relationship and contrasted with [[Parmenides]]' concept of "[[being]]".{{efn|Heraclitus typically uses the ordinary word "to become" (''gignesthai'' or ''ginesthai'', present tense or [[aorist]] tense of the verb, with the root sense of "being born").}}  For this reason, Heraclitus and Parmenides are commonly considered to be two of the founders of [[ontology]] and the issue of the One and the Many, and thus pivotal in the history of Western philosophy and [[metaphysics]].
