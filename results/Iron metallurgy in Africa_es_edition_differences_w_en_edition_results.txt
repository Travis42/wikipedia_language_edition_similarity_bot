Semi-finished iron or steel bars were marketed in parts of West Africa, such as [Sukur], on the Nigeria-Cameroon border, which in the 19th century exported thousands of bars a year north of the [Lake Chad] basin

It was the natural shooting furnace, which is designed to reach the temperatures needed to form and drain the slag by using a chimney effect: the hot air allows more air to attract through the openings at the base

Unlike iron smelters in [[Europe], [[India]] or [[China]], African metalworkers did not use water energy to blow bellows in furnaces that were too large to be blown with hand bellows

A much wider range of smelting processes has been recorded on the African continent than in other parts of the Old World, probably because "bloomeries"—the type of furnace that was once used to melt iron from its oxides—remained in use in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, while in Europe and most of Asia they were replaced by the [high furnace] before most varieties of "bloomeries" could be registered

65-112.</ref> The large masses of slag – from 10,000 to 60,000 tonnes – noticed in some places in Togo, Burkina Faso and Mali reflect the large expansion of iron production in West Africa after the year 1000, which is associated with the diffusion of natural shooting furnace technology

A third problem is the inherent lack of precision of the radiocarbon method itself in the range of 800 to 400 BC, which is attributable to irregular radiocarbon production in the upper atmosphere
