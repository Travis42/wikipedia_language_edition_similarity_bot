To Hitler, Bolshevism meant the consummate rule of Jewry, while democracy – as it had developed in Western Europe and Weimar Germany – represented a preliminary stage of Bolshevism, since the Jews there won a leading, if not yet a dominant, influence

Furthermore, [[Ian Kershaw]] has pointed out that there are several diary entries by [[Joseph Goebbels]] in late 1941, in which Goebbels writes that "the Führer's prophecy is coming true in a most terrible way." The general impression one gets is that Goebbels is quite surprised that Hitler was serious about carrying out the threat in the "Prophecy Speech."

Moderate intentionalists such as Richard Breitman believe that Hitler had decided upon the Holocaust sometime in the late 1930s and certainly no later than 1939 or 1941

Only once in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' does Hitler ever refer to killing Jews, when he states "If at the beginning of the war and during the war twelve or fifteen thousand of these Hebrew corrupters of the people had been held under poison gas, as happened to hundreds of thousands of our very best German workers in the field, the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain." Given that ''Mein Kampf'' is 694 pages long, Dawidowicz's critics contend, she makes too much of one sentence

In 1981, the British historian [[Timothy Mason]] published an essay entitled "Intention and Explanation" that was in part an attack on the scholarship of [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]] and [[Klaus Hildebrand]], both of whom Mason accused of focusing too much on [[Adolf Hitler]] as an explanation of the Holocaust

The phrase 'cumulative radicalisation' is used in this context to sum up the way extreme rhetoric and competition among different Nazi agencies produced increasingly extreme policies, as fanatical bureaucratic underlings put into practice what they believed Hitler would have approved based on his widely disseminated speeches and propaganda

This school makes much of Hitler's "Prophecy Speech" of January 30, 1939 before the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] where Hitler stated "If the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once again into a world war, then the result will not be the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!"<ref>Domarus (1990)

In this essay, Mason called the followers of "the twisted road to Auschwitz"/structuralist school "functionalists" because of their belief that the Holocaust arose as part of the functioning of the Nazi state, while the followers of "the straight road to Auschwitz"/programmist school were called "intentionalists" because of their belief that it was Hitler's intentions alone that explained the Holocaust

Criticism centers on the idea that this explanation does not really show why the Nazis would deport Jews from [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] to death camps in Poland if it was Poland the Nazis were concerned with, and why the Jews of Poland were targeted instead of the random sample of 25% of the Polish population

Given the fact that scholars have written so much in relation to Nazi Germany, Richard Bessel asserts that, "The result is a much better informed, much more detailed and more nuanced picture of the Nazi regime, and most serious historians of the Nazi regime now are to some extent both ‘intentionalists’ and ‘functionalists’- insofar as those terms still can be used at all."<ref>Richard Bessel, "Functionalists vs

 Additional criticism of functionalism points out that Hitler and other Nazi leaders delayed railcars providing supplies to front line troops in the Soviet Union so that Jews could be deported by rail from the USSR to death camps thus demonstrating the pursuit of genocidal policies over pragmatic wartime actions.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=March 2018}}

===Moderate===
Moderate functionalists, such as [[Karl Schleunes]] and [[Christopher Browning]], believe that the rivalry within the unstable Nazi power structure provided the major driving force behind the Holocaust

Although neither side disputes the reality of the Holocaust, nor is there serious dispute over the premise that Hitler (as [[Führer]]) was personally responsible for encouraging the [[anti-Semitism]] that allowed the Holocaust to take place, intentionalists argue the initiative came from above, while functionalists contend it came from lower ranks within the bureaucracy

The Canadian historian Erich Haberer has contended that the “Baltic flashpoint of genocide”, as the killings committed by ''Einsatzgruppe'' A between July–October 1941 are known to historians, were the key development in the evolution of Nazi anti-Semitic policy that resulted in the Holocaust.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=65}} The Baltic area witnessed both the most extensive and intense killings of all the ''Einsatzgruppen'' with 90,000–100,000 Jews killed between July and October 1941, which led to the almost total destruction of the Jewish communities in that area.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=70}} Haberer maintains that the “Baltic flashpoint of genocide” occurred at time when the other Nazi plans for a “territorial final solution” such as the [[Madagascar Plan]] were unlikely to occur, and thus suggested to the Nazi leadership that genocide was indeed “feasible” as a “final solution to the Jewish Question”.{{sfn|Haberer|2001|p=65}}

==Functionalism==
===Extreme===
Extreme functionalists such as [[Götz Aly]] believe that the Nazi leadership had nothing to do with initiating the Holocaust and that the entire initiative came from the lower ranks of the German bureaucracy

It is very likely, moreover, that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' leaders were told of the ''future'' goal of a ''Judenfrei'' [Jew-free] Russia through systematic mass murder.{{sfn|Rees|1997|pp=194–195}} }}
By contrast, the Swiss historian Philippe Burrin argues that such a decision was not made before August 1941 at the earliest, pointing to orders given by Himmler on 30 July 1941 to the 2nd SS Cavalry Regiment and the [[SS Cavalry Brigade]] operating in the [[Pinsk Marshes|Pripet Marshes]] in the [[Pripyat swamps (punitive operation)|Pripyat operation]] calling for the murder of male Jews only while the Jewish women and children were to be driven into the Marshes.{{sfn|Rees|1997|p=195}} Browning argues that sometime in mid-July 1941 Hitler made the decision to begin general genocide owing to his exhilaration over his victories over the Red Army, whereas Burrin contends that the decision was made in late August 1941 owing to Hitler's frustration over the slowing down of the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Rees|1997|p=195}} Kershaw argues that the dramatic expansion in both the range of victims and the intensity of the killings after mid-August 1941 indicates that Hitler issued an order to that effect, most probably a verbal order conveyed to the ''Einsatzgruppen'' commanders through either Himmler or Heydrich.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=259}} It remains unclear whether that was a decision made on Hitler's own initiative motivated only by his own anti-Semitic prejudices, or (impressed with the willingness and ability of ''Einsatzgruppe'' A to murder Jewish women and children) ordered that the other three ''Einsatzgruppen'' emulate ''Einsatzgruppe'' A's bloody example
