Francis Bacon

en edition's differences with the hi version: 


1. 

The following year, during the course of the uneventful first parliament session, Bacon married [[Alice Barnham]].{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=139}} In June 1607 he was at last rewarded with the office of solicitor general.{{sfn|Peltonen|2007}} The following year, he began working as the Clerkship of the [[Star Chamber]]. 

2. 
The inductive method can be seen as a tool used alongside other ideas, such as deduction, which now creates a method which is most effective and used today: the scientific method. 

3. 
The inductive method is more prominent in the scientific method than other ideas, which leads to misconception, but the takeaway is that it has supporting ideas. 

4. 
Although his practical ideas about such a method, the ''[[Baconian method]]'', did not have a long-lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon the father of the scientific method.

===James I comes to the throne===
The succession of [[James I of England|James I]] brought Bacon into greater favour. 

6. 
To support himself, he took up his residence in law at Gray's Inn in 1579,{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=136}} his income being supplemented by a grant from his mother Lady Anne of the manor of [[Marks (manor house)|Marks]] near [[Romford]] in Essex, which generated a rent of £46.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Spall | first = JEH | title = Francis Bacon's connections with Marks Manor House | journal = Romford Record | volume = No.

The Rosicrucian organisation [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis|AMORC]] claims that Bacon was the "Imperator" (leader) of the Rosicrucian Order in both England and the European continent, and would have directed it during his lifetime.<ref name="HistoryofLife">{{cite web |title=The Mastery of Life |url=http://www.rosicrucian.org/about/mastery/mastery.pdf |page=31 |publisher=Rosicrucian.org |accessdate=21 October 2013 }}</ref>

Bacon's influence can also be seen on a variety of religious and spiritual authors, and on groups that have utilised his writings in their own belief systems.<ref>Saint Germain Foundation. 

8. 
Bacon's personal secretary and chaplain, William Rawley, wrote in his biography of Bacon that his marriage was one of "much conjugal love and respect", mentioning a robe of honour that he gave to Alice and which "she wore unto her dying day, being twenty years and more after his death".<ref name="Rawley" />

[[File:Alice Barnham.gif|thumb|Engraving of [[Alice Barnham]]]]

However, an increasing number of reports circulated about friction in the marriage, with speculation that this may have been due to Alice's making do with less money than she had once been accustomed to. 

9. 
In 1613(?), in a letter addressed to King James I on the question of torture's place within English law, Bacon identifies the scope of torture as a means to further the investigation of threats to the state: "In the cases of treasons, torture is used for discovery, and not for evidence."<ref>{{cite book |last=Langbein |first=John H. 

10. 
He is buried at [[St Michael's Church, St Albans]], Hertfordshire.<ref>Wilson, Scott. 

11. 
This method was a new rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, the practical details of which are still central in debates about science and [[methodology]]. 

12. 
However, he argues that Bacon's "rejection" of magic actually constituted an attempt to purify magic of Catholic, demonic, and esoteric influences and to establish magic as a field of study and application paralleling Bacon's vision of science. 

13. 
I know I have clean hands and a clean heart, and I hope a clean house for friends or servants; but Job himself, or whoever was the justest judge, by such hunting for matters against him as hath been used against me, may for a time seem foul, especially in a time when greatness is the mark and accusation is the game.{{sfn|Fowler|1885|p=347}} }}

The true reason for his acknowledgement of guilt is the subject of debate, but some authors speculate that it may have been prompted by his sickness, or by a view that through his fame and the greatness of his office he would be spared harsh punishment. 

14. 
She argues that Bacon's movement for the advancement of learning was closely connected with the German Rosicrucian movement, while Bacon's ''New Atlantis'' portrays a land ruled by Rosicrucians. 

15. 
In 1589, he received the valuable appointment of [[Reversion (law)|reversion]] to the Clerkship of the [[Star Chamber]], although he did not formally take office until 1608; the post was worth £1,600 a year.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=136}}{{sfn|Peltonen|2007}}

In 1588 he became MP for [[Liverpool (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool]] and then for [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex]] in 1593. 

16. 
He later sat three times for [[Ipswich (UK Parliament constituency)|Ipswich]] (1597, 1601, 1604) and once for [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University]] (1614).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/bacon-francis-1561-1626 |title=History of Parliament |accessdate=2 October 2011}}

He became known as a liberal-minded reformer, eager to amend and simplify the law. 

17. 
In 1584 he took his seat in [[Parliament of England|parliament]] for [[Melcombe Regis (UK Parliament constituency)|Melcombe]] in Dorset, and in 1586 for [[Taunton (UK Parliament constituency)|Taunton]]. 

18.

His parliamentary career began when he was elected [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]] for [[Bossiney (UK Parliament constituency)|Bossiney, Cornwall]], in a [[by-election]] in 1581. 

19. 
The so-called Prince's Parliament of April 1614 objected to Bacon's presence in the seat for [[University of Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]] and to the various royal plans that Bacon had supported. 

20. 
Although he was allowed to stay, parliament passed a law that forbade the attorney general to sit in parliament. 

21. 
The diary entry for 3 May 1621—the date of Bacon's censure by Parliament—reveals the full extent of Bacon's homosexuality. 

22. 

One of his biographers, the historian [[William Hepworth Dixon]], states: "Bacon's influence in the modern world is so great that every man who rides in a train, sends a telegram, follows a [[steam plough]], sits in an easy chair, crosses the channel or the Atlantic, eats a good dinner, enjoys a beautiful garden, or undergoes a painless surgical operation, owes him something."<ref>{{cite book |last=Hepworth Dixon |first=William |title="The story of Lord Bacon's Life" (1862) |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zd05AAAAcAAJ&pg=PP1&dq=the+story+of+lord+bacon's+life+hepworth+dixon|year=1862 }}</ref>

In 1902 [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]] published a fictional letter, known as ''[[The Lord Chandos Letter]]'', addressed to Bacon and dated 1603, about a writer who is experiencing a crisis of language. 

23. 
In a plan to revive his position he unsuccessfully courted the wealthy young widow Lady [[Elizabeth Hatton]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Curious Case of Lady Purbeck; A Scandal of the XVIIth Century|last=Longueville|first=Thomas|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co|year=1909|isbn=|location=London|pages=4}}</ref> His courtship failed after she broke off their relationship upon accepting marriage to Sir Edward Coke, a further spark of enmity between the men.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aughterson|first=Kate|date=|title=Hatton, Elizabeth, Lady Hatton [nee Lady Elizabeth Cecil] (1578–1646)|url=|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|volume=|pages=|via=Oxford University Press}}</ref> In 1598 Bacon was arrested for debt. 

24. 
His mother's sister was married to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]], making Burghley Bacon's uncle.<ref>"Sir Francis Bacon's Journals". 

25. 
Bunten wrote in her ''Life of Alice Barnham''<ref>Alice Chambers Bunten, ''Life of Alice Barnham, Wife of Sir Francis Bacon'', London: Oliphants Ltd. 

26. 
On at least one occasion he delivered diplomatic letters to England for [[Francis Walsingham|Walsingham]], Burghley, and [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Leicester]], as well as for the queen.<ref name="travels"/>

The sudden death of his father in February 1579 prompted Bacon to return to England. 

27. 

In 1613 Bacon was finally appointed [[Attorney General for England and Wales|attorney general]], after advising the king to shuffle judicial appointments. 

28. 
In another shrewd move, Bacon wrote his ''Apologies'' in defence of his proceedings in the case of Essex, as Essex had favoured James to succeed to the throne.

===Science===
Bacon's seminal work ''[[Novum Organum]]'' was influential in the 1630s and 1650s among scholars, in particular Sir [[Thomas Browne]], who in his encyclopedia ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' (1646–72) frequently adheres to a Baconian approach to his scientific enquiries. 

30. 
Bacon's opposition to a bill that would levy triple subsidies in half the usual time offended the Queen: opponents accused him of seeking popularity, and for a time the Court excluded him from favour.<ref>Weir, Alison  ''Elizabeth the Queen'' Pimlico 1999 p. 

31. 
"Bacon's celebrity as a philosopher of science has sunk since the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, when he earned the title of 'Father of Experimental Philosophy{{' "}}.</ref>

He also wrote a long treatise on Medicine, ''History of Life and Death'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Bacon |first=Francis |title=History of Life and Death |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dW5lJ9-LeBAC |isbn=978-0-7661-6272-3 |date=1 June 2003 }}</ref> with natural and experimental observations for the prolongation of life. 

32. 
In his Essays, he affirms that "a little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism, but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion."<ref name="EssayesOrCovnsels">{{cite book |last1=Bacon |first1=Francis |title=The Essayes Or Covnsels, Civill and Morall, of Francis Lo. 

33. 
His works are credited with developing the [[scientific method]] and remained influential through the [[scientific revolution]].

Although few of his proposals for law reform were adopted during his lifetime, Bacon's legal legacy was considered by the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' in 1961 as having influenced the drafting of the [[Napoleonic Code]] as well as the law reforms introduced by 19th-century British Prime Minister [[Sir Robert Peel]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Crowther |first=J.G.
