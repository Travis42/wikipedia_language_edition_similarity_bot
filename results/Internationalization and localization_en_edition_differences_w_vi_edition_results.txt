== Business process for internationalizing software ==
In order to ''internationalize'' a product, it is important to look at a variety of markets that the product will foreseeably enter.<ref name="SFW" />

Details such as field length for street addresses, unique format for the address, ability to make the postal code field optional to address countries that do not have postal codes or the state field for countries that do not have states, plus the introduction of new registration flows that adhere to local laws are just some of the examples that make internationalization a complex project.<ref>[http://www.ccjk.com/what-is-internationalization-i18n-localization-l10n-and-globalization-g11n/ Internationalizing a Product: What is Internationalization (i18n), Localization (L10n) and Globalization (g11n)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114350/http://www.ccjk.com/what-is-internationalization-i18n-localization-l10n-and-globalization-g11n/ |date=April 2, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=International Address Formats|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc195167.aspx|website=Microsoft Developer Network|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref>

*Government-assigned numbers have different formats (such as passports, [[Social Security Number]]s and other [[national identification number]]s)

Localization also may take into account differences in culture, such as:
* [[List of holidays by country|Local holidays]]
* [[Personal name]] and [[title]] conventions
* [[Aesthetics]]
* Comprehensibility and cultural appropriateness of images and [[color symbolism]]
* [[Ethnicity]], clothing, and [[socioeconomic status]] of people and architecture of locations pictured

=== Standard locale data ===

Some companies, like [[IBM]] and [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], use the term ''globalization'', ''g11n'', for the combination of internationalization and localization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/software/globalization/|title=IBM  Globalization|date=17 March 2016|publisher=}}</ref> Also known as "[[glocalization]]" (a [[portmanteau]] of ''globalization'' and ''localization'')

Even where large language populations could justify localization for a given product, and a product's internal structure already permits localization, a given software developer or publisher may lack the size and sophistication to manage the ancillary functions associated with operating in multiple locales

== Naming ==

The terms are frequently abbreviated to the [[numeronym]]s '''''i18n''''' (where ''18'' stands for the number of letters between the first ''i'' and the last ''n'' in the word ''internationalization'', a usage coined at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] in the 1970s or 1980s)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.w3.org/2001/12/Glossary#I18N | title=Glossary of W3C Jargon | publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]] | accessdate=2008-10-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.i18nguy.com/origini18n.html | title=Origin of the Abbreviation I18n }}</ref> and ''L10n'' for ''localization'', due to the length of the words.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-i18n | title=Localization vs

Already in the 1990s, companies such as [[Groupe Bull|Bull]] used [[machine translation]] ([[Systran]]) in large scale, for all their translation activity: human translators handled pre-editing (making the input machine-readable) and [[post-editing]].<ref name="SFW" />

== Engineering ==

Both in re-engineering an existing software or designing a new internationalized software, the first step of internationalization is to split each potentially locale-dependent part (whether code, text or data) into a separate module.<ref name="SFW" /><!-- §&nbsp;4.3.1 --> Each module can then either rely on a standard library/dependency or be independently replaced as needed for each locale

=== National conventions ===

Different  countries have different economic conventions, including variations in:
* [[Paper size]]s
* [[Broadcast television systems]] and popular [[storage media]]
* [[National conventions for writing telephone numbers|Telephone number formats]]
* [[Address (geography)#Mailing address format by country|Postal address formats]], [[postal code]]s, and choice of delivery services
* [[Currency]] ([[Currency symbol|symbols]], positions of currency markers, and reasonable amounts due to different [[inflation]] histories) – [[ISO 4217]] codes are often used for internationalization
* [[System of measurement]]
* [[Battery sizes]]
* [[Mains electricity by country|Voltage and current standards]]
In particular, the United States and Europe differ in most of these cases

Different countries have different legal requirements, meaning for example:
* [[Compliance (regulation)|Regulatory compliance]] may require customization for a particular jurisdiction, or a change to the product as a whole, such as:
** [[Privacy law]] compliance
** Additional [[disclaimer]]s on a web site or packaging
** Different consumer labelling requirements
** Compliance with [[export restrictions]] and regulations on [[encryption]]
** Compliance with an [[Internet censorship]] regime or [[subpoena]] procedures
** Requirements for [[accessibility]]
** Collecting different taxes, such as [[sales tax]], [[value added tax]], or [[customs duties]]
** Sensitivity to different political issues, like [[:Category:Geographical naming disputes|geographical naming disputes]] and [[Border dispute|disputed borders]] shown on maps (e.g., India has proposed a controversial bill that would make failing to show [[Kashmir]] and other areas as intended by the government a crime<ref name="HaiderPakistan16">{{cite web |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1258908/pakistan-expresses-concern-over-indias-controversial-maps-bill |title=Pakistan expresses concern over India's controversial 'maps bill' |author=Haider, M

Localization (which is potentially performed multiple times, for different locales) uses the infrastructure or flexibility provided by internationalization (which is ideally performed only once before localization, or as an integral part of ongoing development).<ref>{{cite book|author=Bert Esselink|url=http://isg.urv.es/library/papers/Esselink_Evolution.pdf|title=The Evolution of Localization|series=Guide to Localization|publisher=Multilingual Computing and Technology|year=2003|quote=In a nutshell, localization revolves around combining language and technology to produce a product that can cross cultural and language barriers

World-readiness is a developer task, which enables a product to be used with multiple scripts and cultures (globalization) and separating user interface resources in a localizable format (localizability, abbreviated to ''L12y'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688110.aspx|title=Software Internationalization|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688112.aspx|title=Software Internationalization|publisher=}}</ref>

[[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[HP-UX]] created a system called "National Language Support" or "Native Language Support" (NLS) to produce localizable software.<ref name="SFW" />

According to ''Software without frontiers'', the design aspects to consider when internationalizing a product are "data encoding, data and documentation, software construction, hardware device support, user interaction"; while the key design areas to consider when making a fully internationalized product from scratch are "user interaction, algorithm design and data formats, software services, documentation".<ref name="SFW" />

Translation is typically the most time-consuming component of [[language localization]].<ref name="SFW" /> This may involve:
* For film, video, and audio, translation of spoken words or music lyrics, often using either [[Dub localization|dubbing]] or [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]]
* Text translation for printed materials, digital media (possibly including error messages and documentation)
* Potentially altering images and logos containing text to contain translations or generic icons<ref name="SFW" />
* Different translation length and differences in character sizes (e.g
