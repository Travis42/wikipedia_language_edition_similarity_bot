1. 
For Earth's current orbital eccentricity, incoming solar radiation varies by about 6.8%, while the distance from the Sun currently varies by only 3.4% (5.1&nbsp;million&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]). 

2. 
Summer in the northern hemisphere is 4.66 days longer than winter, and spring is 2.9 days longer than autumn. 

3. 
This is known as ''solar forcing'' (an example of [[radiative forcing]]). 

4. 

===Mars===
[[Mars]] has no moon large enough to stabilize its obliquity, which has varied from 10 to 70 degrees.

In addition, the orbital ellipse itself precesses in space, in an irregular fashion, completing a full cycle every 112,000 years relative to the fixed stars.<ref name=Heuvel>{{cite journal|last1=van den Heuvel|first1=E. 

11. 
 Apsidal precession shortens this period to 23,000 years on average (varying between 20,800 and 29,000 years).<ref name=Heuvel/>

[[File:precession and seasons.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Effects of precession on the seasons (using the [[Northern Hemisphere]] terms).]]
As the orientation of Earth's orbit changes, each season will gradually start earlier in the year. 

12. 
This three-dimensional movement is known as "precession of the ecliptic" or "planetary precession". 

13. 
Earth presently moves through the [[invariable plane]] around January 9 and July 9. 

14. 


Perihelion presently occurs around January 3, while aphelion is around July 4. 

15. 
Axial precession will promote more extreme variation in irradiation of the northern hemisphere and less extreme variation in the south. 

16. 
However, some researchers say the records do not show these peaks, but only show a single cycle of 100,000 years.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/5d5565735578d40943494a793b71d626/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar| title=Nonlinear coupling between 100 ka periodicity of the paleoclimate records in loess and periodicities of precession and semi-precession| publisher=ProQuest}}</ref>

===Axial precession===
{{Main|Axial precession}}
[[File:Earth precession.svg|thumb|right|200px |Axial Precessional movement]]
Axial precession is the trend in the direction of the Earth's axis of rotation relative to the fixed stars, with a period of 25,771.5 years. 

18. 

Apsidal precession combines with the 25,771.5-year cycle of axial precession (see [[#Axial precession|above]]) to vary the position in the year that the Earth reaches perihelion.

21. 
Because most of the planet's snow and ice lies at high latitude, decreasing tilt may encourage the onset of an [[ice age]] for two reasons: There is less overall summer insolation, and also less insolation at higher latitudes, which melts less of the previous winter's snow and ice.

The seasons are quadrants of the Earth's orbit, marked by the two solstices and the two equinoxes. 

23. 
As an illustration, if during an ice age the northern land masses were covered in year-round ice, solar energy would be reflected away, couteracting the eventual warming effect from orbital forcing and extending the ice age. 

24. 
However, the Earth's eccentricity is always so small that the variation in solar irradiation is a minor factor in [[season]]al climate variation, compared to axial tilt and even compared to the relative ease of heating the larger land masses of the northern hemisphere. 

25. 
This would explain recent observations of its surface compared to evidence of different conditions in its past, such as the extent of its [[Martian polar ice caps|polar caps]].<ref>{{Cite journal | bibcode=2008GeoRL..3518201S| title=Temperature response of Mars to Milankovitch cycles| journal=Geophysical Research Letters| volume=35| issue=18| pages=L18201| author=Schorghofer, Norbert| year=2008| doi=10.1029/2008GL034954| url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e983582db0791a41dc16dc32b1086f49357ee71a}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/90annual/techprogram/paper_165827.htm| title=3.5 Modeling Milankovitch cycles on Mars (2010 – 90; Annual Symp Planet Atmos)| publisher= Confex}}</ref>

Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] has a cycle of approximately 60,000 years that could change the location of the [[methane]] lakes.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9sfNegkpPE| title=Hydrocarbon lakes on Titan – Alex Hayes (SETI Talks)| work=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.universetoday.com/46308/lake-asymmetry-on-titan-explained/| title=Lake Asymmetry on Titan Explained| author=Nicholos Wethington| date=30 November 2009| publisher=}}</ref> Neptune's moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] has a variation similar to Titan's, which could cause its solid [[nitrogen]] deposits to migrate over long time scales.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.livescience.com/1349-sun-blamed-warming-earth-worlds.html| title=Sun Blamed for Warming of Earth and Other Worlds| work=LiveScience.com}}</ref>

===Exoplanets===
Scientists using computer models to study extreme axial tilts have concluded that high obliquity could cause extreme climate variations, and while that would probably not render a planet uninhabitable, it could pose difficulty for land-based life in affected areas. 

26. 
Antarctic ice cores contain trapped air bubbles whose ratios of different oxygen isotopes are a reliable [[Proxy (climate)#Proxy|proxy]] for global temperatures around the time the ice was formed. 

27. 
However, the [[semi-major axis]] of the orbital ellipse remains unchanged; according to [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation theory]], which computes the evolution of the orbit, the semi-major axis is [[adiabatic invariant|invariant]]. 

28. 
The Earth spends less time near perihelion and more time near aphelion. 

29. 

Various explanations for this discrepancy have been proposed, including [[frequency modulation]]<ref>{{Citation | last = Rial| first = J.A.| title = Earth's orbital Eccentricity and the rhythm of the Pleistocene ice ages: the concealed pacemaker| journal = Global and Planetary Change| volume = 41| issue = 2| pages =  81–93|date= October 2003| url = http://www.geolab.unc.edu/faculty/rial/GPCRial2.pdf| jstor = | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110720092801/http://www.geolab.unc.edu/faculty/rial/GPCRial2.pdf| archivedate =2011-07-20| doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2003.10.003| bibcode =2004GPC....41...81R}}</ref> or various feedbacks (from [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide]], [[cosmic ray]]s, or from [[ice sheet dynamics]]). 

30. 
Earth's current inclination relative to the [[invariable plane]] (the plane that represents the [[angular momentum]] of the Solar System, approximately the orbital plane of [[Jupiter]]) is 1.57°. 

31. 

==Earth's movements==
The [[Earth]]'s rotation around its axis, and revolution around the [[Sun]], evolve over time due to [[Perturbation (astronomy)|gravitational interactions]] with other bodies in the solar system. 

32. 
This means that solar radiation due to (1) axial tilt inclining the southern hemisphere toward the Sun and (2) the Earth's proximity to the Sun, both reach maximum during the southern summer and both reach minimum during the southern winter. 

33. 
That's why we see a stronger 100,000-year pace than a 21,000-year pace."<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://m.phys.org/news/2017-01-earth-orbital-variations-sea-ice.html |title=Earth's orbital variations and sea ice synch glacial periods |author=Kevin Stacey |publisher=m.phys.org | date=2017-01-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title=Hemispheric sea ice distribution sets the glacial tempo| first1=Jung-Eun| last1=Lee| first2=Aaron| last2=Shen| first3=Baylor| last3=Fox-Kemper| first4=Yi| last4=Ming| date=1 January 2017| journal=Geophys. 

34. 
Finally, the direction in the [[fixed stars]] pointed to by the Earth's [[Earth's Axis|axis]] changes ([[axial precession]]), while the Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun rotates ([[apsidal precession]]). 

35. 

[[File:Earth obliquity range.svg|thumb|right|250px|22.1–24.5° range of Earth's obliquity]]

===Axial tilt (obliquity)===
{{Main|Axial tilt}}
The angle of the Earth's axial tilt with respect to the orbital plane (the obliquity of the [[ecliptic]]) varies between 22.1° and 24.5°, over a cycle of about 41,000 years. 

36.

[[Proxy (climate)|Physical evidence]] shows that the variation in Earth's climate is much more extreme than the variation in the intensity of solar radiation calculated as the Earth's orbit evolves. 

37. 
In the northern hemisphere, these two factors reach maximum at opposite times of the year: The north is tilted toward the Sun when the Earth is furthest from the Sun. 

38. 
Here, cycles can be observed in the colouration and resistance of different strata.]]
Materials taken from the Earth have been studied to infer the cycles of past climate.

===100,000-year issue===
{{Main|100,000-year problem}}
Of all the orbital cycles, Milankovitch believed that obliquity had the greatest effect on climate, and that it did so by varying the summer insolation in northern high latitudes. 

44.

===Interpretation of unsplit peak variances===
Even the well-dated climate records of the last million years do not exactly match the shape of the eccentricity curve. 

45. 

The Earth's current [[orbital inclination]] is 1.57° (see [[#Orbital inclination|above]]). 

46. 
This period is very similar to the 100,000-year eccentricity period.
