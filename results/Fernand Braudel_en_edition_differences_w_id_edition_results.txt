==''L'Identité de la France''==
Braudel's last and most personal book was ''L'Identité de la France'' (''The Identity of France''), which was unfinished at the time of his death in 1985.<ref name ="Lewis" /> Unlike many of Braudel's other books, he made no secret of his profound love of his country,  remarking at the beginning that he had loved France as if she were a woman

At the outbreak of war in 1939, he was called up for military service and in 1940 was taken prisoner by the Germans.<ref name="Hughes" /> He was held at a [[prisoner of war|POW]] camp in [[Mainz]] from 1940 to 1942 before being transferred to a POW camp near [[Lübeck]], where he remained for the rest of the war

In 1962, he wrote ''A History of Civilizations'' as the basis for a history course, but its rejection of the traditional event-based narrative was too radical for the French ministry of education, which in turn rejected it.<ref>Richard Mayne, "Translator's Introduction" in Fernand Braudel, ''A History of Civilization,'' (New York:  Penguin Books, 1993), pp

They rejected the Marxist idea that history should be used as a tool to foment and foster revolutions.<ref>Olivia Harris, "Braudel: Historical Time and the Horror of Discontinuity." ''History Workshop Journal'' (2004) (57): 161–174

Unlike Braudel's other books, ''L'Identité de la France'' was much colored by a romantic nostalgia, as Braudel argued for the existence of [[France profonde|''la France profonde'']], a "deep France" based upon the peasant ''mentalité'' that despite all of the turmoil of French history and the Industrial Revolution had survived intact right up to the present.<ref name ="Lewis" />

==Historiography==
According to Braudel, before the ''Annales'' approach, the writing of history was focused on the ''courte durée'' (short span), or on ''histoire événementielle'' (a history of events)
0.16169

The first level of time, geographical time, is that of the environment, with its slow, almost imperceptible change, its repetition and cycles

==''La Méditerranée''==
His first book, ''La Méditerranée et le Monde Méditerranéen à l'Epoque de Philippe II'' (1949) (''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'') was his most influential
0.168168
Braudel wrote the series both as a way of explanation for the modern way and partly as a refutation of the Marxist view of history.<ref name ="Lewis">Gwynne Lewis, "Braudel, Fernand," in ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', edited by Kelly Boyd (Chicago: FitzRoy Dearborn, 1999) 114.</ref>

Braudel discussed the idea of long-term cycles in the [[Capitalism|capitalist economy]] that he saw developing in Europe in the 12th century

Braudel argued that France was the product not of its politics or economics but rather of its geography and culture, a thesis Braudel explored in a wide-ranging book that saw the ''bourg'' and the ''patois: historie totale'' integrated into a broad sweep of both the place and the time

It is the time of the "''courte durée''" proper and it is the focus of Part 3 of ''The Mediterranean'' which treats of "events, politics and people."

Braudel's Mediterranean is centered on the sea, but just as important, it is also the desert and the mountains
