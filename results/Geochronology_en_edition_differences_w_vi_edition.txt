How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

Geochronology

en edition's differences with the vi version: 


1. 
Many types of luminescence techniques are utilized in geology, including [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL), [[cathodoluminescence]] (CL), and [[thermoluminescence]] (TL). 

2. 
Absolute geochronology can be accomplished through [[radioactive isotopes]], whereas relative geochronology is provided by tools such as [[palaeomagnetism]] and [[stable isotope ratio]]s. 

3.

== Differences from chronostratigraphy ==
It is important not to confuse geochronologic and chronostratigraphic units.<ref>David Weishampel: ''The Evolution and Extinction of the Dinosaurs'', 1996, Cambridge Press, {{ISBN|0-521-44496-9}}</ref> Geochronological units are periods of time, thus it is correct to say that ''[[Tyrannosaurus]] rex'' lived during the Late [[Cretaceous]] Epoch.<ref>Julia Jackson: ''Glossary of Geology'', 1987, American Geological Institute, {{ISBN|0-922152-34-9}}</ref> Chronostratigraphic units are geological material, so it is also correct to say that fossils of the genus ''Tyrannosaurus'' have been found in the Upper Cretaceous Series.<ref>Smith, J.B., Lamanna, M.C., Lacovara, K.J., Dodson, P.

'''Geochronology''' is the [[science]] of [[Chronological dating|determining the age]] of [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[fossil]]s, and [[sediment]]s using signatures inherent in the rocks themselves. 

10. 
Its range is from a few years to about 700,000 years. 

11. 
A number of radioactive isotopes are used for this purpose, and depending on the rate of decay, are used for dating different geological periods. 

12. 
Thermoluminescence and optically stimulated luminescence are used in archaeology to date 'fired' objects such as pottery or cooking stones and can be used to observe sand migration. 

13. 

=== Luminescence dating ===
Luminescence dating techniques observe 'light' emitted from materials such as quartz, diamond, feldspar, and calcite.
