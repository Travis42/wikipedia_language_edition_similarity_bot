The astronomical calendar, which pre- or retroactively estimates the orbits of [Artificial Objects] and [Satellite] (including [GPS] satellites), is calculated by specialized agencies

In addition, as a celestial calendar of pre-estimation, those applicable to a longer period of time (but schematic accuracy) are also broadcast together, this is distinguished from the [GPS] specifications --> almanac (Almanac, "almanac") in the sense that distinguishes from the [GPS] !-- [[GPS] [ephemeris]
0.0901526
The basic calendar deals with the geometric position of the celestial body obtained by integrating the equation of motion of the celestial body, and the visual celestial calendar deals with the visual position of the celestial body obtained by the coordinate transformation and the correction of [[light difference ] [planetary light difference] based on the basic calendar

It is also referred to as ''astronomical calendar''', ''[calendar]',''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' (alma astronomical yearbook)
0.0967994
In modern times, the accuracy of the astronomical calendar has become more and more elaborate due to the development of modern methods such as radar to measure the distance of planets and the use of communication data with planetary probes

!-- [[Chinese calendar]] had a side as a celestial calendar in addition to [[calendar]] (Koyomi, calendar, calendar) to determine the day of the month.].>>

Currently, the celestial calendar can be divided into the basic calendar (fundamental ephemeris) and the visual astronomical calendar (apparent ephemeris)
0.134237
Therefore, the astronomical calendar is not only the position prediction of the celestial body, but also various [astronomical constants] such as the size of [mass] and [astronomical unit] of the planet that is a parameter of the theory are determined at the same time, and it is also [source of information]
