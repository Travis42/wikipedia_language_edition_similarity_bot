Bracher was mainly concerned with the problems of preserving and developing [[democracy]].<ref name="Dijk page 112"/> Bracher was consistent in all his works in arguing for the value of human rights, pluralism and constitutional values, together with urging that Germans align themselves with the democratic values of the West.<ref name="Dijk page 112"/> He saw democracy as a frail institution and has argued that only a concerned citizenry can guarantee it.<ref name="Dijk page 112"/> This theme began with Bracher's first book in 1948, ''Verfall und Fortschritt im Denken der frühen römischen Kaiserzeit'' which concerned the downfall of the [[Roman Republic]] and the rise of [[Augustus]]

During the ''[[Historikerstreit]]'' (Historians' Dispute) of the 1986–88, Bracher argued in a letter to the editor of ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' published on 6 September 1986 that nothing new was being presented by either side.<ref name="Bracher pages 72-73">Bracher, Karl Dietrich "Letter to the Editor of the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', September 6, 1986" pages 72–73 from ''Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler?'' edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, N.J

Brüning openly admitted in his memoirs that the purpose of the "presidential government" was to do away with democracy and restore the monarchy by bringing back the exiled Wilhelm II, and complained at much length about how unfair it was that Schleicher had turned Hindenburg against him in the spring of 1932, leading to the president to fire him and replace him with Papen.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard page 180"/> It is noteworthy that Brüning did not object to Papen's policies in his memoirs, but rather to the fact that he would have carried out the same policies if only his beloved Field Marshal Hindenburg had given him the chance, instead of firing him in May 1932.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard page 180"/> Through Bracher won the debate with Conze, as late as 1971 Bracher deplored the tendency to take "a conservative and all too benevolent view of the presidential regime" as an attempt to save democracy.<ref>Kolb, Eberhard ''The Weimar Republic'', London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 181.</ref> After the publication of Brüning's memoirs, which largely confirmed Bracher's thesis, Bracher wrote that the coming of presidential government was "not a move to save democracy, but part of a conscious plan to bring about a right-wing regime independent of party and parliament and to keep the Social Democrats out of power...Brüning's policy oscillated between the defense of a bureaucratic version of a state based on the rule of law, and paving the way for a dictatorship...He was not...the last chancellor ''before'' the break-up of the Weimar Republic, but the first chancellor ''in'' the process of destroying German democracy".<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard page 182">Kolb, Eberhard ''The Weimar Republic'', London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 182.</ref> In a survey of the historiography of the Weimar republic, Kolb wrote that research since the 1970s has confirmed Bracher's damning picture of Brüning that he had first offered in 1955, when the evidence for it was weaker.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard page 182"/>

Bracher sharply criticized the Social Democrats for not resisting the ''[[Preußenschlag]]'' launched by [[Franz von Papen]] that saw the ''Reichswehr'' oust the Social Democratic government of [[Otto Braun]].<ref>Kolb, Eberhard ''The Weimar Republic'', London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 185</ref> Bracher wrote through the ''Reichswehr'' would had probably crushed any resistance, but:<blockquote>"there remained the possibility of a lasting demonstration, a manifestation of the unbroken will of democracy to assert itself against a temporarily superior force

In Bracher's view, Hitler was the “Master of the Third Reich”.<ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 73">Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship : Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London : Arnold ; New York page 73.</ref> However, though Bracher argues that the Führer was the driving force behind the Third Reich, he was one of the first historians to argue that Nazi Germany was less well organized than the Nazis liked to pretend.<ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 73"/> In a 1956 essay, Bracher noted "the antagonism between rival agencies was resolved solely in the omnipotent key position of the Führer", which was the result of "...the complex coexistence and opposition of the power groups and from conflicting personal ties".<ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 73"/> Unlike the functionists, Bracher saw this disorganization as part of a conscious “divide and rule” strategy on the part of Hitler, and argued at no point was Hitler ever driven by pressure from below or had his power limited in any way.<ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 73"/> One area where Bracher is in agreement with the functionists concerns the highly ''ad hoc'' nature of decision-making in the Third Reich

The road from democracy to dictatorship was not a particular German case, but the radical nature of the National Socialist dictatorship corresponded to the power of the German ideology that in 1933–1945 became a political and totalitarian reality"<ref name="Lukacs, John page 201"/></blockquote> The ''Sonderbewusstsein'' Bracher referred to was the original theory of the ''Sonderweg'', namely the idea of the Prussian-German state as the great Central European power neither of the West nor of the East, but rather was something special and unique; this ideology emphasised opposition to democracy as part of its opposition to "Western civilization"
0.203226
His 1955 book ''Die Auflösung der Weimarer Republik'' (''The Disintegration of the Weimar Republic'') is his best known book, in which he ascribed the collapse of German democracy not to the ''[[Sonderweg]]'' ("special path" of German historical development) or other impersonal forces but to human action that followed conscious choice.<ref name="Dijk page 112"/> In that book, Bracher rejected not only the ''Sonderweg'' thesis, but also the Marxist theory of National Socialism as the result of a capitalist "conspiracy", the theory that the [[Treaty of Versailles]] caused the collapse of the Weimar Republic, and the view that the Nazi dictatorship was simply the work of "fate".<ref name="Dijk page 112"/> Bracher's methodology in ''Die Auflösung der Weimarer Republik'' involving a mixture of political science and history was considered to be highly innovative and controversial in the 1950s.<ref name="Dijk page 112"/> The German historian [[Eberhard Kolb]] wrote ''Die Auflösung der Weimarer Republik''  was "still unsurpassed as a work of research" on the end of the Weimar Republic.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard page 132">Kolb, Eberhard ''The Weimar Republic'', London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 132.</ref> Bracher wrote that though almost all Germans rejected the Treaty of Versailles, this dislike of Versailles had nothing with do with the coming of "presidential government" in March 1930 or rise of the Nazi Party starting with the September 1930 ''Reichstag'' election.<ref>Kolb, Eberhard ''The Weimar Republic'', London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 169.</ref> Furthermore, Bracher wrote that under Weimar, the judicial system had already politicized as the judges, almost all of whom had begun their careers in the Imperial era, had a tendency to impose very lenient sentences for political crimes done in the name of the right.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard page 36">Kolb, Eberhard ''The Weimar Republic'', London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 36.</ref> In ''Die Auflösung der Weimarer Republik'', Bracher wrote the judiciary was in part responsible for the collapse of the Weimar republic, "contributing to its overthrow by authoritarian and totalitarian movements."<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard page 36"/>

Bracher argued the beginning of the end of the Weimar Republic was the coming of "presidential government" in 1930 as starting with government of Heinrich Brüning, Chancellors not sought to govern via the ''Reichstag'', instead using the "25/48/53 formula", which was legal, but violated the spirit of the constitution as Article 54 had explicitly stated the Chancellor and his cabinet were responsible to the ''Reichstag''.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard page 132"/> Bracher maintained that the end of German democracy was not inevitable, but instead was due to conscious choices coupled with "momentous errors and failures" made by Germany's leaders, especially President Paul von Hindenburg.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard page 132"/> In ''Die Auflösung der Weimarer Republik'', Bracher argued the "collapse" of the republic went through several stages:
*The "loss of power" with Brüning as the cabinet governed only with Article 48, instead of the ''Reichstag''.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard page 110">Kolb, Eberhard ''The Weimar Republic'', London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 110.</ref>
*The "power vacuum" with Franz von Papen and Kurt von Schleicher as democracy was gutted, but neither men could build a new system in their short time in office.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard page 110"/> 
*The "seizure of power" by the National Socialists in 1933.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard page 110"/>
Bracher in writing of a "loss of power" and a "power vacuum" was referring to the decay of the democratic system, not a weakening of the state.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard page 111">Kolb, Eberhard ''The Weimar Republic'', London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 111.</ref> Kolb noted in the years 1930–33, the ''Reichswehr'', the bureaucracy, the police and above all President von Hindenburg all saw a dramatic increase in their power, and what was happening in Germany in that period was the gradual collapse of the democratic system with policy decisions increasingly being made by the ''Reichswehr'' and the ''[[Camarilla|Kamarilla]]'' of President Hindenburg instead of the ''Reichstag''.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard page 111"/>

Bracher argued that the system of "presidential government" was intended to and had the effect of weakening democracy, and that in no way was "presidential government" forced on Hindenburg and his Chancellors by an unmanageable crisis.<ref>Kolb, Eberhard ''The Weimar Republic'', London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 pages 132–33.</ref> Bracher's thesis that [[Heinrich Brüning]] and even more so, his successor [[Franz von Papen]] had gutted German democracy involved him in a dispute with [[Werner Conze]], a prominent Nazi historian under the Third Reich who emerged as a leading conservative historian in West Germany in the 1950s.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard page 133">Kolb, Eberhard ''The Weimar Republic'', London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 133.</ref> In a series of articles published in the 1950s–60s, Conze argued that by 1929–1930 that German politics had become so dysfunctional that Hindenburg had no other choice, but to reluctantly bring in "presidential government" as the only to provide Germany with any sort of government, and that Brüning's governing via Article 48 was only a temporary measure intended to save democracy from the crisis caused by the Great Depression.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard page 133"/> In reply, Bracher wrote a series of article documenting that the plans for "presidential government" went back much to 1926 at least, and argued that there was no unmanageable crisis with parliamentary government in 1930 that made "presidential government" unavoidable.<ref>Kolb, Eberhard ''The Weimar Republic'', London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 pages 179–180.</ref> Bracher forcefully argued that was no structural crisis in 1929–30 so severe that Hindenburg had to turn to "presidential government" as Conze was claiming, instead arguing that Hindenburg, his ''kamarilla'', and the ''Reichswehr'' had been seeking long before the Great Depression to do away with democracy.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard page 180">Kolb, Eberhard ''The Weimar Republic'', London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 page 180.</ref> In this regard, Bracher pointed out that General [[Kurt von Schleicher]] and [[Heinrich Brüning]] had worked out the plan for a "presidential government" by April 1929, and it was only Hindenburg's desire to have the government of [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]] pass the Young Plan, which its turn was delayed by the Young Plan referendum of November 1929, that gave Müller almost an extra year in office.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard page 180"/>

Bracher's thesis about the Brüning government as the first step towards dissolving democracy instead of an effort to save it as maintained by Conze, was greatly supported by the posthumous publication of Brüning's memoirs in 1970.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard page 180"/> Brüning, a conservative Catholic who never married and is not known to had a relationship with any women during the course of his life, revealed himself in his memoirs to be a man with an unhealthy emotional dependence on Hindenburg, to whom he was slavishly devoted and whom he regarded in homoerotic terms as the epitome of German masculinity and strength
0.205126
Knopf, 1997 pages 202–203.</ref> </blockquote>

Bracher was highly critical of the Marxist view of the Third Reich, which sees the Nazi leadership as puppets of Big Business.<ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 51">Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship : Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London : Arnold ; New York page 51.</ref> In Bracher's opinion, the exact opposite was the case with a "primacy of politics" being exercised with business subordinate to the Nazi regime rather than a "primacy of economics" as maintained by Marxist historians.<ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 51"/> Bracher argued that Nazi actions were dictated by Nazi ideological theory, that business interests were just as much subordinate to the dictatorship as any other section of society, and that since Nazi actions were often irrational from a purely economic point of view, a "primacy of politics" prevailed.<ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 51"/>

Against the functionalist view of the Third Reich mostly associated with left-wing historians, Bracher was to write that it was an attempt to: <blockquote>"turn against the "old-liberal" totalitarianism theory and talk about a relativizing interpretation, which emphasizes the "improvisational" politics of power and domination of National Socialism
0.208303
This might, beyond all justified practical calculations, have make it possible to save the democratic consciousness from the psychological and moral collapse of the republican forces; it made have made the way harder for the new rulers; delayed future developments and lessened their effects".<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard pages 185">Kolb, Eberhard ''The Weimar Republic'', London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 pages 185.</ref></blockquote> Bracher wrote that up until July 1932, those Germans who believed in democracy had high spirits and were full of fighting determination to take a stand, and after the  ''Preußenschlag'', the same people became demoralized and passive, feeling that they were playing in a game whose rules were rigged against them, losing their fighting spirit.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard pages 185"/> Bracher's views about the "Rape of Prussia" as Papen's coup was also known involved him in heated debate with Arnold Brecht, who maintained that nothing could be done to oppose the ''Preußenschlag'' as that would mean breaking the law.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard pages 133">Kolb, Eberhard ''The Weimar Republic'', London: Unwin Hyman, 1988 pages 133.</ref> Bracher in his turn argued that Papen's reasons for his coup-namely the Social Democrats and the Communists were about to merge into a "united left" to start a Marxist revolution in Germany-were patently absurd, and given that Papen's intention was to dissolve democracy, that there are times when it is acceptable to break the law.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard pages 133"/> Bracher argued that Brecht's thesis that resistance to Papen's coup was impossible because it would have meant breaking the law was just an excuse for passivity.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard pages 185"/> Historians have generally agreed with Bracher's thesis that there are times when in the face of injustice committed by those who hold power that it is acceptable to break the law, and that the ''Preußenschlag'' was one of those times when illegality in defense of democracy would have been justified.<ref name="Kolb, Eberhard pages 185"/>

=== 1960s ===
In Bracher's opinion, through it was human choices that led to the collapse of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the National Socialist period, the roots of National Socialism can be traced back towards the [[Völkisch movement|''völkisch'' ideology]] of 19th century [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], which found their fullest expression in the personality of [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref>Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship : Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London : Arnold ; New York page 44.</ref> Likewise, Bracher complained that too many Germans were willing during the Weimar-Nazi time periods to subscribe to a "readiness for acclamatory agreement and pseudo-military obedience to a strong authoritarian state".<ref>Marrus, Michael ''The Holocaust In History'' Toronto: Key Porter, 2000 page 85.</ref> Through Bracher was opposed to the ''Sonderweg'' interpretation of German history, he did believe in a special German mentality (''Sonderbewusstsein'') that made the Third Reich possible.<ref name="Lukacs, John page 201">Lukacs, John ''The Hitler of History'', New York: Alfred A

Shirer]]'s ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'' were best-sellers, while a book like ''Die nationalsozialistische Machtergreifung'', which Laqueur regarded as infinitely better work of scholarship then Shirer's  book was unlikely ever to be translated into English, let alone become a bestseller.<ref>Laqueur, Walter Review of ''Die nationalsozialistische Machtergreifung: Studien zur Errichtung des totalitaren Herrschaftssystems in Deutschland 1933/34'' pages 235–236 from ''International Affairs'', Volume 37,  Issue # 2 April 1961 page 236.</ref>

Bracher advocated the view that Nazi Germany was a [[totalitarian]] regime, through Bracher maintained that the "totalitarian typology" as developed by [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] and [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] was too rigid, and that totalitarian models needed to be based upon careful empirical research.<ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 25">Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship : Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London : Arnold ; New York page 25.</ref> In Bracher's view, Friedrich's and Brzezinski's work failed to take into account the "revolutionary dynamic", which Bracher argued was the "core principle" of totalitarism.<ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 25"/> For Bracher, the essence of totalitarism was the total claim to control and remake all aspects of society together with an all-embracing ideology, the value on authoritarian leadership, and the pretence of the common identity of state and society, which distinguished the totatitarian "closed" understanding of politics from the "open" democratic understanding.<ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 25"/> In Bracher's view, "politics is the struggle for the power of the state", and in his opinion, the traditional methods of the historian have to be supplemented by the methods of political science to properly understand [[political history]].<ref>Iggers, Georg ''The German Conception of History'', Middletown: Connecticut; Wesleyan University Press, 1968 page 266.</ref> Speaking of historical work in his own area of speciality, namely the Weimar-Nazi periods, Bracher stated: <blockquote>"It was not with Himmler, Bormann, and Heydrich, also not with the National Socialist Party, but with Hitler that the German people identified itself enthusiastically

It is his position that the entire project of the genocide of European Jewry resulted from Adolf Hitler's anti-Semitic hatred.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Bracher argued that the "one basic principle to which Hitler subscribed deeply, blindly and ruthlessly" was anti-Semitism.<ref name="Dawidowicz, Lucy S pages 91-93"/> Bracher noted that the ''Shoah'' was so important to Hitler that during World War II, resources that might from a purely military point of view be better devoted to the war were instead turned towards genocide.<ref>Dawidowicz, Lucy S

Bracher commented that the Nazi regime "remained in a state of permanent improvisation".<ref>Marrus, Michael ''The Holocaust In History'', Toronto: Key Porter, 2000 page 46.</ref>

=== 1970s ===
In a 1971 essay to mark the 100th anniversary of German unification, Bracher rejected the claim that [[Otto von Bismarck]] was the "grandfather" of the present-day Federal Republic, and argued that those historians who claimed that there was a line of continuity between Bismarck's Second Reich and the Federal Republic were entirely mistaken

In particular, Bracher warned of the "tendency, through theorizing and ideologizing alienation from the history of persons and events, to show and put into effect as the dominant leading theme the contemporary criticism of capitalism and democracy".<ref>Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship : Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London : Arnold page 16.</ref> Along the same lines, Bracher criticized the return to what he regarded as the crude [[Comintern]] theories of the 1920-1930s which labeled democracy as a form of "late capitalist" and "late bourgeois" rule, and of the New Left practice of referring to the Federal Republic as a "restorative" Nazi state.<ref>Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship : Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London : Arnold page 15.</ref>

=== 1980s ===
In the introduction to his 1982 book ''Zeit der Ideologien'' (''Age of Ideologies''), Bracher wrote: "When the realization of high-pitched political expectations was found to come up against certain limits, there was a revival of the confrontation, especially painful in Germany and one that was generally believed to have been overcome".<ref name="Dijk page 112"/> Bracher attacked Communism under the grounds that its claim to have  "scientifically" worked out the laws of history was the source of "its great strength vis-à-vis supporters and sympathizers but also its extremely intolerant and coercive character.”<ref>{{cite web|last=Herf|first=Jeffery|title=Karl Dietrich Bracher (1922–2016)|work=The American Interest|date=22 September 2011|url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/10/01/karl-dietrich-bracher-1922-2016/|doi=|accessdate=5 October 2015}}</ref> Bracher wrote: “Communist policies are something mystical, something surpassing the rational capability of the individual, something fully accessible only to the collective and its leadership,” which promoted itself as “an exclusively informed elite.”<ref>{{cite web|last=Herf|first=Jeffery|title=Karl Dietrich Bracher (1922–2016)|work=The American Interest|date=22 September 2011|url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/10/01/karl-dietrich-bracher-1922-2016/|doi=|accessdate=5 October 2015}}</ref> As part of his critique of Communism, Bracher wrote:<blockquote>"No limits were  to that elite’s supranational competence…

The great examples of this cult of leadership and pseudo-religious veneration and adoration are Lenin and Stalin and at present Mao and the North Korean demigod Kim Il Sung".<ref name="ReferenceC"/> However, at the same time, Bracher argued in totalitarian regimes, the position of the leader by its very definition meant that he had an oversized role in making history, thus making the study of the leader a prerequisite for understanding these regimes.<ref>Bracher, Karl Dietrich "The Role of Hitler" pages 211–225 from ''Fascism: A Reader's Guide'' Harmondsworth, 1976 pages 214–215.</ref>

In Bracher's view, Hitler's rise was not inevitable, and the primary responsibility for the Chancellorship being given to Hitler on 30 January 1933 rested with the ''[[Camarilla|Kamarilla]]'' of President [[Paul von Hindenburg]].<ref name="Bracher pages 211-225">Bracher, Karl Dietrich "The Role of Hitler" pages 211–225 from ''Fascism: A Reader's Guide'' Harmondsworth, 1976 page 217.</ref> Bracher wrote that had Hindenburg chosen differently from that the path that he did chose by appointing Hitler chancellor on 30 January 1933 that German history would easily gone in a completely different direction, thus meaning that even through Hindenburg died in 1934, he must bear ultimate responsibility for everything that happened between 1933–45,  for the appointment of Hitler was a purely a gratuitous act on Hindenburg's part that he did not have to do.<ref name="Bracher pages 211-225"/> However, Bracher argued that once Hitler had obtained power, he used his authority to carry out a comprehensive revolution that politically destroyed both Hitler's opponents such as the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and his allies such as the [[German National People's Party|DNVP]] who sought to “tame” the Nazi movement.<ref name="Bracher pages 211-225"/> Bracher argued that because Hitler was so central to the Nazi movement that it led to the fate of National Socialism being so intertwined with Hitler's fate that it is right, as noted above, to speak of National Socialism as Hitlerism, and hence justifying Hitler's place in history as a person who by their actions decisively brought about events that otherwise would not had occurred.<ref name="ReferenceA">Bracher, Karl Dietrich "The Role of Hitler" pages 211–225 from ''Fascism: A Reader's Guide'' Harmondsworth, 1976 page 215.</ref> In addition, Bracher maintained that the importance of Hitler derived from his being the most effective exponent of an extremely radical type of racist German nationalism, which allowed for ideas that otherwise would be ignored by historians coming to a terrible fruition.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Though Bracher argued that the work of [[Ralf Dahrendorf]], [[David Schoenbaum]], and [[Henry Ashby Turner]] about National Socialism in pursuit of anti-modern goals leading to an unintentional modernization of German society had merit, Bracher felt the question of modernization was too removed from the essence of National Socialism, which Bracher argued were the total revolutionary remodeling of the world along savagely [[Racism|racist]] and [[Social Darwinism|Social Darwinist]] lines.<ref>Bracher, Karl Dietrich "The Role of Hitler" pages 211–225 from ''Fascism: A Reader's Guide'' Harmondsworth, 1976 pages 220–221.</ref> In Bracher's opinion, the revolution Hitler sought to unleash was besides being one of racism gone mad, was also a moral revolution.<ref>Bracher, Karl Dietrich "The Role of Hitler" pages 211–225 from ''Fascism: A Reader's Guide'' Harmondsworth, 1976 page 222.</ref> Bracher argued that the Nazi revolution sought to destroy traditional values that society had valued such as friendship, kindness, and so forth, and replace them with values such as cruelty, brutality, and destruction.<ref>Bracher, Karl Dietrich "The Role of Hitler" pages 211–225 from ''Fascism: A Reader's Guide'' Harmondsworth, 1976 pages 222–223.</ref> Bracher argued that because [[Anti-Semitism]] was so crucial to Hitler's ''weltanschauung'' (worldview) and its consequences in the form of genocide for the Jews of Europe were such that this disapproves any notion of generic fascism because Bracher believes that theories of fascism cannot account for the ''Shoah''.<ref name="ReferenceB">Bracher, Karl Dietrich "The Role of Hitler" pages 211–225 from ''Fascism: A Reader's Guide'' Harmondsworth, 1976 pages 217–218.</ref> Bracher argued that generic fascism theorists were guilty of indiscriminately lumping in too many disparate phenomena for the concept of fascism to be of any intellectual use, and of using the term fascist as a catch-all insult for anyone the left disliked.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> With respect to the genesis of  [[The Holocaust]], he is a confirmed [[Functionalism versus intentionalism|Intentionalist]]

35</ref> In a 2003 interview with the ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' newsmagazine, Bracher was highly critical of Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]’s opposition to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq war]], and warned against using [[anti-Americanism]] to win elections as potentially damaging Germany’s relations with the United States, a development that Bracher much deplored”.<ref>{{cite news|last=Deggerich|first=Markus|authorlink=Karl Dietrich Bracher|title=Ein schwerer Missgriff|publisher=Spiegel|date=February 2008|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,232675,00.html|doi=|accessdate=28 June 2008|newspaper=Spiegel Online}}</ref> He died on 19 September 2016 at the age of 94.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/nachruf-karl-dietrich-bracher-der-lehrer-der-bonner-republik-14445078.html |title = Nachruf Karl Dietrich Bracher: Der Lehrer der Bonner Republik|newspaper = Faz.net|last1 = Bahners|first1 = Patrick}}</ref> The American historian [[Jeffrey Herf]] wrote in an obituary: <blockquote>"The complaints about democracy and liberalism that Bracher examined in ''The German Dictatorship'' find echoes in our own time
