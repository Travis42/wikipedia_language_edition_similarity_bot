How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

The [[American Philosophical Society]], patterned on the [[Royal Society]] ([[London]]), was founded in Philadelphia in 1743. 

2. 
Performing roles that include system design and development and system analysis. 

3. 
Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata. 

4. 
A symbol vocabulary and a system of logic are combined to enable [[inference]]s about elements in the KR to create new KR sentences.

Poole begins the ''Index to Periodical Literature,'' the first general periodical literature index in the US. 

6. 
Much of this research has drawn on the work done by Leckie, Pettigrew (now Fisher) and Sylvain, who in 1996 conducted an extensive review of the LIS literature (as well as the literature of other academic fields) on professionals' information seeking.

===19th century===
[[File:Joseph Marie Jacquard.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Joseph Marie Jacquard]]]]
By the 19th century the first signs of information science emerged as separate and distinct from other sciences and social sciences but in conjunction with communication and computation. 

16. 
Social media allows interaction through simple to learn and access tools; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' offers an app through Facebook, and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' goes a step further and offers an independent social app that was downloaded by 19.5 million users in 6 months,<ref name=facebook /> proving how interested people are in the new way of being provided information. 

17. 
In 1731, [[Benjamin Franklin]] established the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]], the first library owned by a group of public citizens, which quickly expanded beyond the realm of books and became a center of scientific experiment, and which hosted public exhibitions of scientific experiments.<ref>Korty, Margaret Barton. 

18. 
They further made themselves multidisciplinary by incorporating disciplines in the sciences, humanities and social sciences, as well as other professional programs, such as [[law]] and [[medicine]] in their curriculum.

===Social media's power to facilitate topics===

The connections and networks sustained through social media help information providers learn what is important to people. 

20. 
Through social media people are directed to, or provided with, information by people they know. 

21. 
People like to interact with information, they enjoy including the people they know in their circle of knowledge. 

22. 
The KR can be made to be independent of the underlying knowledge model or knowledge base system (KBS) such as a [[semantic network]].<ref name="martin" >[http://www.webkb.org/doc/papers/iccs02/iswc02.pdf "Knowledge representation in RDF/XML, KIF, Frame-CG and Formalized-English"], Philippe Martin, Distributed System Technology Centre, QLD, Australia, July 15–19, 2002</ref>

Knowledge Representation (KR) research involves analysis of how to reason accurately and effectively and how best to use a set of symbols to represent a set of facts within a knowledge domain. 

23. 

=== Knowledge representation and reasoning ===
Knowledge representation (KR) is an area of [[artificial intelligence]] research aimed at representing knowledge in symbols to facilitate [[inference|inferencing]] from those [[knowledge]] elements, creating new elements of knowledge.
