How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

Ephemeris

en edition's differences with the ja version: 


1. 
*13th century – the ''[[Alfonsine Tables]]'' were compiled in Spain to correct anomalies in the ''Tables of Toledo'', remaining the standard European ephemeris until the ''[[Prutenic Tables]]'' almost 300 years later. 

2. 
|accessdate=13 March 2019}}</ref>     
*1496 – the ''Almanach Perpetuum'' of [[Abraham Zacuto|Abraão ben Samuel Zacuto]] (one of the first books published  with a [[movable type]] and [[printing press]] in [[Portugal]])
*1504 – While shipwrecked on the island of Jamaica, [[Christopher Columbus]] successfully predicted a lunar eclipse for the natives, using the ephemeris of the German astronomer [[Regiomontanus]]. 

3. 
*2nd century AD – the ''Almagest'' and the ''Handy Tables'' of [[Ptolemy]]
*8th century AD – the ''{{transl|ar|[[zīj]]}}'' of [[Ibrāhīm al-Fazārī]]
*9th century AD – the ''{{transl|ar|zīj}}'' of [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]]
*12th century AD – the ''[[Tables of Toledo]]'' – based largely on Arabic ''{{transl|ar|zīj}}'' sources of [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Islamic astronomy]] – were edited by [[Gerard of Cremona]] to form the standard European ephemeris until the ''[[Alfonsine Tables]]''. 

4. 
Some of the astronomical phenomena of interest to astronomers are [[eclipse]]s, [[apparent retrograde motion]]/planetary stations, planetary {{linktext|ingress}}es, [[sidereal time]], positions for the mean and true [[Lunar node|nodes of the moon]], the [[phases of the Moon]], and the positions of minor [[celestial bodies]] such as [[2060 Chiron|Chiron]]. 

5. 
*1975 – [[Owen Gingerich]], using modern planetary theory and digital computers, calculates the actual positions of the planets in the 16th Century and graphs the errors in the planetary positions predicted by the ephemerides of Stöffler, Stadius and others. 

6. 
 That is, the error patterns for Stöffler are different from those of Stadius, but the error patterns of Stadius closely resemble those of [[Maestlin]], [[Giovanni Antonio Magini|Magini]], [[David Origanus|Origanus]], and others who followed the Copernican parameters."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gingerich |first=Owen |date=1975 |title="Crisis" versus Aesthetic in the Copernican Revolution |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4258973/Crisis%20vs%20Aesthetic%20OGingrich.pdf |journal=Vistas in Astronomy |publisher=[[Elsevier BV]] |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=85–95 |access-date=23 June 2016}}</ref>

== Modern ephemeris ==
For scientific uses, a modern planetary ephemeris comprises software that generates positions of planets and often of their satellites, [[asteroid]]s, or [[comet]]s, at virtually any time desired by the user. 

7. 

Other modern ephemerides recently created are the EPM (Ephemerides of Planets and the Moon), from the Russian Institute for Applied Astronomy of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pitjeva|first=Elena V.|title=The dynamical model of the planet motions and EPM ephemerides|journal=Highlights of Astronomy|date=August 2006|volume=14|pages=470|doi=10.1017/S1743921307011453|bibcode=2007HiA....14..470P}}</ref> and the INPOP (''{{lang|fr|Intégrateur numérique planétaire de l'[[Observatoire de Paris]]}}'') by the French [[IMCCE]].<ref>{{cite web|title=INPOP10e, a 4-D planetary ephemeris|url=http://www.imcce.fr/inpop/|publisher=IMCCE|accessdate=2 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Viswanathan |first1=V. 

8. 
*13th century AD - the ''[[Dresden Codex]]'', an extant Mayan ephemeris
*1408 – [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese]] ephemeris table (copy in [[Pepysian Library]], Cambridge, UK (refer book '1434'); Chinese tables believed known to [[Regiomontanus]]). 

9. 
Reflecting the continuing influx of new data and observations, [[NASA]]'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory ([[JPL]]) has revised its [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris|published ephemerides]] nearly every year for the past 20 years.<ref>[[Georgij A.

Software is widely available to assist with this form of navigation; some of this software has a self-contained ephemeris.<ref>{{cite book | title = American Practical Navigator: An Epitiome of Navigation | date = 2002 | page = 270 | publisher = National Imagery and Mapping Agency | location = Bethesda, MD | url = http://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_62&pubCode=0002}}</ref> When software is used that does not contain an ephemeris, or if no software is used, position data for celestial objects may be obtained from the modern ''[[Nautical Almanac]]'' or ''Air Almanac''.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Almanacs and Other Publications — Naval Oceanography Portal| accessdate = 11 November 2016| url = http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/publications | publisher = [[United States Naval Observatory]] }}</ref>

An ephemeris is usually only correct for a particular location on the Earth.
