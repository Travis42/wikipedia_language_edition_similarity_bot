Cut-marks on [[Neanderthal |Neandertal]] bones from various sites - such as [[Combe Grenal]] and the Moula [[rock shelter]] in [[France]] - may imply that Neanderthals, like some contemporary human cultures, may have practiced [[excarnation]] for presumably religious reasons (see [[Neanderthal behavior#Cannibalism or ritual defleshing?| Neanderthal behavior § Cannibalism or ritual defleshing?]]).

==Origin of behavioral modernity==

The earliest evidence of [[behavioral modernity]] first appears during the Middle Paleolithic; undisputed evidence of behavioral modernity, however, only becomes common during the following Upper Paleolithic period.<ref name="Miller2006"/>

Middle Paleolithic burials at sites such as [[Krapina]] in Croatia (dated to {{circa}} 130,000 BP) and the [[Skhul and Qafzeh hominids| Qafzeh and Es Skhul caves]] in Israel ({{circa}} 100,000 BP) have led some anthropologists and archeologists (such as [[Philip Lieberman]]) to believe that Middle Paleolithic cultures may have possessed a developing [[religious]] ideology which included concepts such as an [[afterlife]]; other scholars suggest the bodies were buried for secular reasons.<ref name="evolving_graves">{{cite web |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_24_160/ai_81827792/ |title= Evolving in their graves: early burials hold clues to human origins |date=2001-12-15| author=Ben Harder| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623015743/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_24_160/ai_81827792/ |archivedate=2012-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|ref= harv|last= Lieberman|first= Philip|authorlink= Philip Lieberman|title= Uniquely Human: The Evolution of Speech, Thought, and Selfless Behavior|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3tS2MULo5rYC&pg=PA162|year= 1991|publisher= Harvard University Press|isbn= 978-0-674-92183-2}}</ref>

According to recent{{when?|date=November 2019}} archeological findings from ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' sites in the [[Atapuerca Mountains]], the practice of intentional burial may have begun much earlier during the late [[Lower Paleolithic]], but this theory is widely questioned in the scientific community.

According to the theory of the [[recent African origin of modern humans]], [[anatomically modern human]]s began migrating out of Africa during the Middle Stone Age/Middle Paleolithic around 100,000 or 70,000 years ago and began to replace earlier pre-existent ''Homo'' species such as the Neanderthals and ''[[Homo erectus]]''.<ref>''[http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/johanson.html Origins of Modern Humans: Multiregional or Out of Africa?]'' By Donald Johanson</ref> However, recent discoveries of fossils originating from Israel indicate that our species ([[Homo sapiens]]) lived outside of Africa 185,000 years ago; some 85,000 years earlier than previous evidence suggests.
