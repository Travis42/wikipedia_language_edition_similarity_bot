How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

'''Chronobiology''' is a field of [[biology]] that examines periodic (cyclic) phenomena in living organisms and their adaptation to [[sun|solar]]- and [[moon|lunar]]-related rhythms.<ref name="chrono">{{cite book |author=Patricia J. 

4. 
The term ''circadian'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''circa'', meaning "around" and ''dies'', "day", meaning "approximately a day." It is regulated by [[circadian clock]]s. 

5. 
The best studied rhythm in chronobiology is the [[circadian rhythm]], a roughly 24-hour cycle shown by physiological processes in all these organisms.

* [[Diurnality|Diurnal]], which describes organisms active during daytime
* [[Nocturnal]], which describes organisms active in the night
* [[Crepuscular]], which describes animals primarily active during the dawn and dusk hours (ex: white-tailed deer, some bats)

While [[circadian rhythms]] are defined as regulated by [[endogenous]] processes, other biological cycles may be regulated by exogenous signals. 

7. 

==History==
A circadian cycle was first observed in the 18th century in the movement of plant leaves by the French scientist [[Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan]].<ref>for a description of circadian rhythms in plants by de Mairan, Linnaeus, and Darwin see [http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/museum/exhibit00/02_1.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225212335/http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/museum/exhibit00/02_1.html |date=2005-12-25 }}</ref> In 1751 Swedish [[botanist]] and [[naturalist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]] (Carl von Linné) designed a [[Linnaeus' flower clock|flower clock]] using certain species of [[flowering plant]]s. 

8. 

[[Franz Halberg]] of the [[University of Minnesota]], who coined the word ''circadian'', is widely considered the "father of American chronobiology." However, it was [[Colin Pittendrigh]] and not Halberg who was elected to lead the ''Society for Research in Biological Rhythms'' in the 1970s. 

9. 

Many other important cycles are also studied, including:
* [[Infradian rhythm]]s, which are cycles longer than a day. 

10. 
Examples include [[Circannual Cycle|circannual]] or annual cycles that govern migration or reproduction cycles in many plants and animals, or the human [[menstrual cycle]]. 

11. 
* [[Ultradian rhythm]]s, which are cycles shorter than 24 hours, such as the 90-minute [[REM cycle]], the 4-hour [[nasal cycle]], or the 3-hour cycle of [[growth hormone]] production.

The variations of the timing and duration of biological activity in living organisms occur for many essential biological processes.

Humans can have a propensity to be morning people or evening people; these behavioral preferences are called [[chronotype]]s for which there are various assessment questionnaires and biological marker correlations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Power of When|last=Breus, PHD|first=Michael|publisher=Little Brown and Company|year=2016|isbn=978-0-316-39126-9|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>

In the second half of 20th century, substantial contributions and formalizations have been made by Europeans such as [[Jürgen Aschoff]] and [[Colin Pittendrigh]], who pursued different but complementary views on the phenomenon of [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the circadian system by light (parametric, continuous, tonic, gradual vs.
