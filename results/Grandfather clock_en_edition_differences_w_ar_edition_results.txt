These consumed less power allowing clocks to run longer between windings, caused less friction and wear in the movement, and were more accurate.<ref name="Headrick" /> Almost all longcase clocks use a ''[[seconds pendulum]]'' (also called a "Royal" pendulum<ref>{{cite book

In Sweden a special variety of longcase clocks was made in [[Mora, Sweden|Mora]], called [[Mora clock]]s
-4.48199e-09
These are about a metre (39&nbsp;inches) long (to the centre of the bob), requiring a long narrow case
-4.48199e-09
The long narrow case actually predated the anchor clock by a few decades, appearing in clocks in 1660 to allow a long drop for the powering weights

Modern longcase clocks use a more accurate variation of the anchor escapement called the [[deadbeat escapement]]

[[File:Tim Mason.XXX.jpg|thumb|Lateral view of a [[Timothy Mason (clockmaker)|Timothy Mason]] longcase clock movement with striking mechanism, circa 1730]]

The anchor mechanism reduced the pendulum's swing to around 4° to 6°,<ref name="Headrick" /> allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums, which had slower "beats"

Until the early 20th century, pendulum clocks were the world's most accurate timekeeping technology, and longcase clocks, due to their superior accuracy, served as time standards for households and businesses

Cable clocks are wound by inserting a special crank (called a "key") into holes in the clock's face and turning it
