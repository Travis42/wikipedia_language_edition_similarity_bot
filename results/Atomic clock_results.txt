When electrons return to near the nucleus, due to different charge-pulling forces, the electrons vibrate before silence in the new place
0.00677775
Adjustments try to remove side effects, such as frequencies from other electron transitions, distortion in the quantum field and temperature effects in those mechanisms

The hours [[Rubidium]] are highly liked because of their low price, and its small size (commercial standard is as small as 400 &nbsp; cm <sup> 3 </sup>), and a short-term stability
0.0469577
The content of the atomic clock is a microwave cavity (resonance hole) containing ionized gas, a tunable microwave oscillator, and a feedback loop used to set the oscillator to the most precise frequency of the absorption characteristic of absorption, which is determined by the behavior of each atom

The maser for frequency reference uses a twinkle-filled room (or chamber) containing the ionized gas, generally [caesium]], as caesium is a [[element]] used in the international [second] official definition
0.0948885
The system has short-term accuracy, with long-term accuracy equivalent to the national standard Time [[United States]]
0.0948886
's first accurate [[] National Bureau of Standards] atomic clock, based on the transition from atom [caesium]]-133, created by [Louis Essen]] in [[1955]] in [[The National Physical Laboratory]] in Britain
0.103041
When radio frequencies coincide with the hyperfine transition of caesium, the caesium atom absorbs radio waves and then emits light
0.12522
[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]-NIST (National Institutes of Standards and technology of the United States) maintains the accuracy of 10 <sup> âˆ’ 9 </sup> [seconds]] per day, and the same precision as radio frequencies of pumped transmitters
0.134193
This definition makes the [oscillator]] caesium (which is often called atomic clock) as the main standard for [time]] and frequency measurements (see [[Standard caesium]])
0.207125
When the light is dimmed because the frequency of stimulation has shifted from the resonance frequency, the electronic equipment between the photocell and the radio transmitter adjust the frequency of the radio transmitter
0.222856
For community use, another time scale is used, [UTC | Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC)
0.243999
Thus, the ultra-accurate properties of the quantum mechanics of the caesium atomic transition frequency can be used to tune the microwave oscillator to the same frequency (except for minor experimentation errors)
