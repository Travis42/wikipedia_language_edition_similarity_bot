How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.

Lunisolar calendar

en edition's differences with the hu version: 


1. 

==With uncounted time==
An alternative way of dealing with the fact that a solar year does not contain an integer number of months is by including uncounted time in the year that does not belong to any month. 

2. 
</ref> lunisolar calendars track more or less the tropical year whereas the Buddhist and Hindu lunisolar calendars track the sidereal year. 

3. 
The classic [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] cycle can be reproduced by assigning an initial epact value of 1 to the last year of the cycle and incrementing by 11 each year. 

4. 
 The civil versions of the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s are [[solar calendar|solar]], because their dates do not indicate the Moon phase &mdash; however, both the Gregorian and Julian calendars include undated lunar calendars that allow them to [[Computus|calculate]] the Christian celebration of [[Easter]], so both are lunisolar calendars in that respect. 

5. 

== Determining leap months ==
{{Original research|section|date=June 2019}}
A rough idea of the frequency of the intercalary or leap month in all lunisolar calendars can be obtained by the following calculation, using approximate lengths of months and years in days:
*Year: 365.25, Month: 29.53
*365.25/(12 Ã— 29.53) = 1.0307
*1/0.0307 = 32.57 common months between leap months
*32.57/12 = 2.7 common years between leap years

Intercalation of leap months is frequently controlled by the "epact", which is the difference between the lunar and solar years (approximately 11 days). 

6. 
Between the last year of one cycle and the first year of the next the increment is 12. 

7. 
For instance, the [[Sts'Ailes|Chehalis]] began their count of lunar months from the arrival of spawning [[chinook salmon]] (in Gregorian calendar October), and counted 10 months, leaving an uncounted period until the next chinook [[salmon run]].<ref>Suttles, Wayne P. 

8. 
This increases the usual number of common months between leap months to roughly 34 months when a doublet of common years occurs, while reducing the number to about 29 months when only a common singleton occurs. 

9. 
"Pre-Islamic and agricultural calendars of the Arabian peninsula", ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam'', 2nd edition, '''X''':260.</ref> The Chinese, Coligny and
Hebrew<ref>The modern Hebrew calendar, since it is based on rules rather than observations, does not exactly track the tropical year, and in fact the average Hebrew year of ~365.2468 days is intermediate between the tropical year (~365.2422 days) and the sidereal year (~365.2564 days). 

10. 

The  Buddhist and Hebrew calendars restrict the leap month to a single month of the year; the number of common months between leap months is, therefore, usually 36, but occasionally only 24 months. 

11. 
Because the Chinese and Hindu lunisolar calendars allow the leap month to occur after or before (respectively) any month but use the true motion of the [[Sun]], their leap months do not usually occur within a couple of months of [[perihelion]], when the apparent speed of the Sun along the [[ecliptic]] is fastest (now about 3 January). 

12. 
In this case ordinary years consist of twelve months but every second or third year is an [[embolismic month|embolismic year]], which adds a thirteenth [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary]], embolismic, or leap month. 

13. 

==Examples==
The [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew]], [[Jain calendar|Jain]], [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist]], [[Hindu calendar|Hindu]] and [[Kurdish calendar|Kurdish]] as well as the traditional  [[Burmese calendar|Burmese]], [[Chinese calendar|Chinese]], [[Japanese calendar|Japanese]], [[Tibetan calendar|Tibetan]], [[Vietnamese calendar|Vietnamese]], [[Mongolian calendar|Mongolian]] and [[Korean calendar|Korean]] calendars (in the [[east Asian cultural sphere]]), plus the ancient [[Hellenic calendars|Hellenic]], [[Coligny calendar|Coligny]], and [[Babylonian calendar]]s are all lunisolar. 

14. 
If the solar year is defined as a [[tropical year]], then a lunisolar calendar will give an indication of the [[season]];{{example needed|date=June 2019}}if it is taken as a [[sidereal year]], then the calendar will predict the [[constellation]] near which the [[full moon]] may occur.{{example needed|date=June 2019}}As with all calendars which divide the year into months there is an additional requirement that the year have a whole number of months.
