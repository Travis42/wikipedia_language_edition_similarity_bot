The Maya wrote whether the lunar month was 29 or 30 days as two glyphs: a glyph for lunation length followed by either a glyph made up of a moon glyph over a bundle with a suffix of 9 for a 29-day lunation or a moon glyph with a suffix of 10 for a 30-day lunation.

18. 

==Short count==
During the late Classic period the Maya began to use an abbreviated short count instead of the Long Count. 

19. 

Arithmetically, the duration of the Calendar Round is the [[least common multiple]] of 260 and 365; 18,980 is 73 × 260 Tzolkʼin days and 52 × 365 Haabʼ days.<ref>For further details, see Thompson 1966: 123–124</ref>

Not every possible combination of Tzolkʼin and Haabʼ can occur. 

20. 
For one, the four years headed by the Year Bearers are named after them and share their characteristics; therefore, they also have their own prognostications and patron deities.<ref>For a thorough treatment of the Year Bearers, see Tedlock 1992: 89–90; 99–104 and Thompson 1966</ref> Moreover, since the Year Bearers are geographically identified with boundary markers or mountains, they help define the local community.<ref>See Coe 1965</ref>

The classic system of Year Bearers described above is found at Tikal and in the [[Dresden Codex]]. 

21. 
This is the ''[[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|Long Count]]''. 

22. 
The Long Count 0.0.1.0.0 represents 360 days, rather than the 400 in a purely base-20 ([[vigesimal]]) count. 

23. 
The monumental inscriptions would not only include the 5 digits of the Long Count, but would also include the two tzolkʼin characters followed by the two haabʼ characters. 

24. 
This nine-day cycle was usually written as two glyphs: a glyph that referred to the Nine Lords as a group, followed by a glyph for the lord that would rule the next night. 

25. 
114</ref> In the kingdoms of Postclassic Yucatán, the Short Count was used instead of the Long Count. 

26. 
The cyclical Short Count is a count of 13&nbsp;kʼatuns (or 260&nbsp;tuns), in which each kʼatun was named after its concluding day, Ahau ('Lord'). 

27. 

===Lunar Series===
A lunar series generally is written as five glyphs that provide information about the current [[New moon|lunation]], the number of the lunation in a series of six, the current ruling lunar deity and the length of the current lunation.

In this system the Year Bearers are the same as in the 1 Pop – Campeche system. 

32. 
As the winal unit resets after only counting to 18, the Long Count consistently uses base-20 only if the tun is considered the primary unit of measurement, not the kʼin; with the kʼin and winal units being the number of days in the tun.

==Tzolkʼin==

The ''[[tzolkʼin]]'' (in modern Maya [[orthography]]; also commonly written ''tzolkin'') is the name commonly employed by Mayanist researchers for the Maya Sacred Round or 260-day calendar.

The Haabʼ month names are known today by their corresponding names in colonial-era [[Yucatec Maya language|Yukatek Maya]], as transcribed by 16th-century sources (in particular, [[Diego de Landa]] and books such as the ''[[Chilam Balam]]'' of Chumayel).

Since there are twenty [[Tzolkʼin]] day names and the [[Haabʼ]] year has 365 days (20*18 + 5), the [[Tzolkʼin]] name for each succeeding [[Haabʼ]] zero day will be incremented by 5 in the cycle of day names like this:

It is a count of days since a mythological starting-point.<ref>"Mythological" in the sense that when the Long Count was first devised sometime in the Mid- to Late Preclassic, long after this date; see e.g. 

55. 

Since the Long Count dates are unambiguous, the Long Count was particularly well suited to use on monuments.

Day numbers began with a glyph translated as the "seating of" a named month, which is usually regarded as day 0 of that month, although a minority treat it as day 20 of the month preceding the named month.

Phonemic analyses of Haabʼ glyph names in pre-Columbian [[Maya script|Maya inscriptions]] have demonstrated that the names for these twenty-day periods varied considerably from region to region and from period to period, reflecting differences in the base language(s) and usage in the Classic and Postclassic eras predating their recording by Spanish sources.<ref>Boot (2002), pp.&nbsp;111–114.</ref>

Each day in the Haabʼ calendar was identified by a day number in the month followed by the name of the month.

By the [[Maya mythology|Maya mythological]] tradition, as documented in Colonial Yucatec accounts and reconstructed from Late Classic and Postclassic inscriptions, the deity [[Itzamna]] is frequently credited with bringing the knowledge of the calendar system to the ancestral Maya, along with [[writing system|writing]] in general and other foundational aspects of Maya culture.<ref>See entry on ''Itzamna'', in Miller and Taube (1993), pp.99–100.</ref>

Since Calendar Round dates repeat every 18,980 days, approximately 52 solar years, the cycle repeats roughly once each lifetime, so a more refined method of dating was needed if history was to be recorded accurately.

==Supplementary Series==
Many Classic period inscriptions include a series of glyphs known as the Supplementary Series. 

74. 
Since the Maya didn't use fractions, lunations were approximated by using the formula that there were 149 lunations completed in 4400 days, which yielded a rather short mean month of exactly <sup>4400</sup>/<sub>149</sub> = 29+<sup>79</sup>/<sub>149</sub> days = 29 days 12 hours 43 minutes and 29+<sup>59</sup>/<sub>149</sub> seconds, or about 29.5302 days.<ref>Teeple 1931:67</ref>

==819-day count==
Some Mayan monuments include glyphs that record an 819-day count in their Initial Series. 

75. 

Because the Haabʼ had 365 days and the [[tropical year]] is 365.2422 days, the days of the Haabʼ did not coincide with the tropical year. 

76. 

==Calendar Round==
A Calendar Round date is a date that gives both the Tzolkʼin and Haabʼ. 

77. 
As a whole number, the number of days per lunation will be either 29 or 30 days, with the 30-day intervals necessarily occurring slightly more frequently than the 29-day intervals. 

78. 
The cycle was counted from katun 11&nbsp;Ahau to katun 13&nbsp;Ahau, with the coefficients of the katuns' concluding days running in the order 11&nbsp;– 9&nbsp;– 7&nbsp;– 5&nbsp;– 3&nbsp;– 1&nbsp;– 12&nbsp;– 10&nbsp;– 8&nbsp;– 6&nbsp;– 4&nbsp;– 2&nbsp;– 13&nbsp;Ahau (since a division of 20 × 360 days by 13 falls 2 days short).
