If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

One of the areas in which case studies have been gaining popularity is education and in particular educational evaluation.<ref name=MacDonald2006>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/0305764750050101 |title=Case‐study and the Social Philosophy of Educational Research |journal=Cambridge Journal of Education |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=2–11 |year=2006 |last1=MacDonald |first1=Barry |last2=Walker |first2=Rob }}</ref><ref name=MacDonald1978>{{cite journal |last=MacDonald |first=Barry |year=1978 |title=The Experience of Innovation |journal=CARE Occasional Publications |issue=6 }}{{pn|date=December 2017}}</ref><ref name=Kushner2000>{{cite book |last=Kushner |first=S.

Teaching case studies have been a highly popular pedagogical format in many fields ranging from business education to science education. 

3. 
Alternatively it may be chosen because of researchers' in-depth local knowledge; where researchers have this local knowledge they are in a position to "soak and poke" as [[Richard Fenno]] put it,<ref name=Fenno2014>{{cite journal |last=Fenno |first=Richard F.

The resulting body of 'case study research' has long had a prominent place in many disciplines and professions, ranging from psychology, anthropology, sociology, and political science to education, clinical science, social work, and administrative science.<ref name="Mills2010">{{cite book |editor1-last=Mills |editor1-first=Albert J.

Research in business disciplines is usually based on a [[positivist]] [[epistemology]],<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Wai Fong |last1=Chua |date=October 1986 |title=Radical Developments in Accounting Thought |journal=The Accounting Review |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=601–32 |jstor=247360 }}</ref> namely, that reality is something that is objective and can be discovered and understood by a scientific examination of empirical evidence. 

6. 
The primary methods used include: interviews, surveys, focus groups, observations and in some cases, field trials.<ref>Guesalaga et al., 2016{{full|date=December 2017}}</ref> The methods chosen rely heavily on the amount of capital the organization is able to spend and the kind of data that is required by the group.

The idea behind these studies is that the collection of past studies will allow for greater generalization without additional cost or time being expended on new, possibly repetitive studies.

Three types of cases may thus be distinguished for selection:

# Key cases
# Outlier cases
# Local knowledge cases

Whatever the frame of reference for the choice of the subject of the case study (key, outlier, local knowledge), there is a distinction to be made between the '''subject''' and the '''object''' of the case study.
