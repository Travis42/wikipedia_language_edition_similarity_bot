Late Bronze Age collapse

en edition's differences with the fa version: 


1. 
The Hittites, already weakened by a series of military defeats and annexations of their territory by the Middle Assyrian Empire (which had already destroyed the Hurrian-Mitanni Empire)  then suffered a [[coup de grâce]] when [[Hattusa]]s, the Hittite capital, was burned, probably by the [[language isolate]]-speaking [[Kaskians]], long indigenous to the southern shores of the [[Black Sea]], and possibly aided by the incoming Indo-European–speaking [[Phrygians]]. 

2. 

In the specific context of the [[Middle East]], a variety of factors – including population growth, [[soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]], drought, cast bronze weapon and iron production technologies – could have combined to push the relative price of weaponry (compared to [[arable land]]) to a level unsustainable for traditional warrior aristocracies. 

3. 

Every Anatolian site, apart from integral [[Assyria]]n regions in the south east, and regions in eastern, central and southern Anatolia under the control of the powerful [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1392–1050 BC) that was important during the preceding Late Bronze Age, shows a [[destruction layer]] and it appears that in these regions civilisation did not recover to the level of the Assyrians and Hittites for another thousand years or so.

====Greece====
{{Main|Greek Dark Ages}}

None of the Mycenaean palaces of the Late Bronze Age survived (with the possible exception of the [[Cyclopean]] fortifications on the [[Acropolis of Athens]]), with destruction being heaviest at palaces and fortified sites. 

6. 
The extent of this destruction is highlighted by Robert Drews who reasons that the destruction was such that Thebes did not resume a significant position in Greece until at least the late 12th century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The end of the Bronze Age : changes in warfare and the catastrophe ca.

The Bronze Age collapse marked the start of what has been called the [[Greek Dark Ages]], which lasted roughly 400 years and ended with the establishment of [[Archaic Greece]]. 

8. 
After the Assyrian withdrawal, it was still subject to periodic Assyrian (and [[Elamite]]) subjugation, and new groups of [[Semitic people|Semites]], such as the [[Aramaeans]], [[Suteans]] (and in the period after the Bronze Age Collapse, [[Chaldea]]ns also), spread unchecked into Babylonia from the Levant, and the power of its weak kings barely extended beyond the city limits of Babylon.

The modern term 'Syria' is a later Indo-European corruption of 'Assyria' which only became formally applied to the Levant during the [[Seleucid Empire]] (323–150 BC) (see [[Etymology of Syria]]). 

11. 
 By 1020 BC Assyria appears to have controlled only the areas in its immediate vicinity; the well-defended Assyria itself was not threatened during the collapse.

==== Drought ====
Speculation of drought as a cause in the collapse of the Late Bronze Age has been targeted in research studies.

Before and during the Bronze Age Collapse, Syria became a battle ground between the empires of the [[Hittites]], [[Middle Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]], [[Mitanni]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] between the 15th and late 13th centuries BC, with the Assyrians destroying the Hurri-Mitanni empire and annexing much of the Hittite empire.

[[File:Tíryns.jpg|thumb|View of the Megaron of the palace at Tiryns, one of the many Greek palaces destroyed during the Bronze Age Collapse.]]
Up to 90% of small sites in the [[Peloponnese]] were abandoned, suggesting a major depopulation.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Again, as with many of the sites of destruction in Greece, it is unclear how a lot of this destruction came about. 

15. 
During this period, from the 12th century BC, the incoming [[Northwest Semitic]]-speaking [[Arameans]] came to demographic prominence in Syria, the region outside of the Canaanite-speaking [[Phoenicia]]n coastal areas eventually came to speak [[Aramaic]] and the region came to be known as [[Aramea]] and [[Eber Nari]]. 

16. 
[[Phrygians]], [[Cimmerians]] and [[Lydians]] arrived in Asia Minor, and a new Hurrian polity of [[Urartu]] formed in eastern Asia Minor and the southern Caucasus, where the [[Colchians]] ([[Georgian people|Georgians]]) also emerged. 

17. 
The Egyptian empire had withdrawn from the region after failing to overcome the Hittites and being fearful of the ever-growing Assyrian might, leaving much of the region under Assyrian control until the late 11th century BC.

===Areas that survived===

====Mesopotamia====
The [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1392–1056 BC) had destroyed the [[Hurrian]]-[[Mitanni]] [[Empire]], annexed much of the [[Hittite Empire]] and eclipsed the [[Egyptian Empire]], and at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age collapse controlled an empire stretching from the [[Caucasus mountains]] in the north to the [[Arabian peninsula]] in the south, and from [[Ancient Iran]] in the east to [[Cyprus]] in the west.

1200 B.C.'', 1993.</ref> According to [[Robert Drews]]: 
<blockquote>
Within a period of forty to fifty years at the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the twelfth century almost every significant city in the eastern Mediterranean world was destroyed, many of them never to be occupied again.<ref>

</blockquote>

Only a few powerful states, particularly [[Assyria]], [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] (albeit badly weakened), and [[Elam]], survived the Bronze Age collapse – but by the end of the 12th century BC, Elam waned after its defeat by [[Nebuchadnezzar I]], who briefly revived Babylonian fortunes before suffering a series of defeats by the Assyrians. 

21. 
''The Collapse of Complex Societies'' (Cambridge University Press).</ref> hypothesises how social declines in response to complexity may lead to a collapse resulting in simpler forms of society. 

22. 
The Arameans, together with the [[Phoenicia]]n Canaanites and  [[Neo-Hittites]] came to dominate most of the region demographically, however these people, and the Levant in general, were also conquered and dominated politically and militarily by the Middle Assyrian Empire until Assyria's withdrawal in the late 11th century BC, although the Assyrians continued to conduct military campaigns in the region. 

23. 
Letters on clay tablets that were baked in the conflagration caused by the destruction of the city speak of attack from the sea, and a letter from [[Alashiya]] ([[Cyprus]]) speaks of cities already being destroyed by attackers who came by sea. 

24. 
Palmer suggested that [[iron (material)|iron]], superior to bronze for weapons manufacturing, was in more plentiful supply and so allowed larger armies of iron users to overwhelm the smaller bronze-equipped armies that consisted largely of [[Maryannu]] [[chariot]]ry.<ref>Palmer, Leonard R (1962).

===General systems collapse===

A general [[systems collapse]] has been put forward as an explanation for the reversals in culture that occurred between the [[Urnfield culture]] of the 12th and 13th centuries BC and the rise of the Celtic [[Hallstatt culture]] in the 9th and 10th centuries BC.<ref>[http://www.iol.ie/~edmo/linktoprehistory.html http://www.iol.ie/~edmo/linktoprehistory.html] History of Castlemagner, on the web page of the local historical society.</ref> General systems collapse theory, pioneered by [[Joseph Tainter]],<ref>Tainter, Joseph (1976).

[[Alashiya]] was plundered by the Sea Peoples and ceased to exist in 1085. 

27. 
However Assyria gradually withdrew from much of the region for a time in the second half of the 11th century BC, although they continued to campaign militarily at times, in order to protect their borders and keep trade routes open, until a renewed vigorous period of expansion in the late 10th century BC. 

28. 
From 935 BC Assyria began to reorganise and once more expand outwards, leading to the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–605 BC), which came to control a vast area from the Caucasus to Egypt, and from Greek Cyprus to Persia. 

29. 
However, in the 12th century BC, Assyrian satrapies in [[Anatolia]] came under attack from the [[Mushki]] ([[Phrygians]]), and those in the Levant from [[Arameans]], but [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (reigned 1114–1076 BC) was able to defeat and repel these attacks, conquering the incomers. 

30. 

====Egypt====
After apparently surviving for a while, the Egyptian Empire collapsed in the mid-twelfth century BC (during the reign of [[Ramesses VI]], 1145 to 1137 BC). 

31. 
The Middle Assyrian Empire survived intact throughout much of this period, with Assyria dominating and often ruling [[Babylonia]] directly, controlling south east and south western [[Anatolia]], north western [[Iran]] and much of northern and central [[Syria]] and [[Canaan]], as far as the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Cyprus]].<ref name="auto1">Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq''</ref>

The [[Arameans]] and [[Phrygians]] were subjected, and Assyria and its colonies were not threatened by the [[Sea Peoples]] who had ravaged Egypt and much of the East Mediterranean, and the Assyrians often conquered as far as [[Phoenicia]] and the [[East Mediterranean]].
