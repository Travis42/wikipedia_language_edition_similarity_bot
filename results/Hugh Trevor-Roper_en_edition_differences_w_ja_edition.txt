Despite controversies over historical accuracy in oral records, as in [[Alex Haley]]'s ''Roots'' book and popular TV mini-series, African griots, or oral memoirists, provided a historical oral record. 

13. 
In his essays in social history, written during the 1950s and 1960s, Trevor-Roper was influenced by the work of the French [[Annales School]], especially [[Fernand Braudel]] and did much to introduce the work of the ''Annales'' school to the [[English-speaking world]]. 

14. 
In 1948, a paper put forward by Stone in support of Tawney's thesis was vigorously attacked by Trevor-Roper, who showed that Stone had exaggerated the debt problems of the Tudor nobility.<ref name="autogenerated1">Brown, Kenneth "Tawney, R.H." pages 1172–1173 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'' page 1173.</ref> He also rejected Tawney's theories about the rising gentry and declining nobility, arguing that he was guilty of selective use of evidence and that he misunderstood the statistics.<ref name="autogenerated1" /><ref>H.

Another feud was with the novelist and Catholic convert [[Evelyn Waugh]], who was angered by Trevor-Roper's repeated harsh attacks on the Catholic Church.<ref>Sisman, (2010) pp 178, 261, 291</ref>

In the [[Nazi Foreign Policy (debate)|globalist–continentalist debate]] between those who argued that Hitler aimed to conquer the world and those who argued that he sought only the conquest of Europe, Trevor-Roper was one of the leading continentalists.

Nonetheless, the incident prompted the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' to nickname him ''Hugh Very-Ropey'' (''Lord Lucre of Claptout''), or more concisely Lord Facre.

The first was ''Letters from Oxford'', a collection of letters written by Trevor-Roper between 1947–59 to his close friend the American art collector [[Bernard Berenson]].

21. 
Working rapidly, Trevor-Roper drafted his report, which served as the basis for his most famous book, ''The Last Days of Hitler'' in which he described the last ten days of Hitler's life, and the fates of some of the higher-ranking members of the inner circle as well of key lesser figures. 

22. 

For an example, Backhouse claimed in ''Decadence Mandchoue'' that the wives and daughters of British diplomats in Beijing had trained their dogs and tamed foxes to perform [[cunnilingus]] on them, which the fascistic Backhouse used as evidence of British "decadence", which in turn explained why he was supporting Germany and Japan in the Second World War. 

23. 
* ''A Hidden Life: The Enigma of Sir Edmund Backhouse'' (published in the US, and in later [[Eland Books|Eland]] editions in the UK, as ''The Hermit of Peking: The Hidden Life of Sir Edmund Backhouse''), 1976. 

24. 
Trevor-Roper regarded ''Decadence Mandchoue'' with considerable distaste calling the manuscript "pornographic" and "obscene" as Backhouse related in graphic detail sexual encounters he claimed to have had with the French poet [[Paul Verlaine]], the Irish playwright [[Oscar Wilde]], Wilde's lover [[Lord Alfred Douglas]], the French poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]], the Russian ballet dancer [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], the British Prime Minister [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]] and the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] of China whom the openly gay Backhouse had maintained had forced herself on him.<ref name="Trevor-Roper, Hugh pages 295">Trevor-Roper, Hugh ''The Hermit of Peking'', New York: Alfred Knopf, 1976 pages 295–296.</ref>

Backhouse also claimed to have been the friend of the Russian novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] and the French actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]]. 

25. 

==Military service in World War II==
During [[World War II]], Trevor-Roper served as an officer in the Radio Security Service of the [[Secret Intelligence Service]], and then on the interception of messages from the German intelligence service, the ''[[Abwehr]]''.<ref name="J. 

26. 
Backhouse had between 1898 and his death in 1944 worked as a sinologist, the business agent for several British and American companies in China, a British spy, gun-runner and translator before finally ending his days in World War II China as a fascist and a Japanese collaborator who wished fervently for an Axis victory which would destroy Great Britain.<ref name="Trevor-Roper, Hugh pages 295"/> Trevor-Roper noted that despite Backhouse's homosexuality and Nazi Germany's policy of persecuting homosexuals, Backhouse's intense hatred of his own country together with his sadistic-masochistic sexual needs meant that Backhouse longed to be "...ravished and possessed by the brutal, but still perverted masculinity of the fascist ''Führerprinzip''".<ref>Trevor-Roper, Hugh ''The Hermit of Peking'', New York: Alfred Knopf, 1976 page 295.</ref>

The end result was one of Trevor-Roper's most successful later books, his 1976 biography of Backhouse, originally entitled ''A Hidden Life'' but soon republished in Britain and the US as ''The Hermit of Peking''. 

27. 

==="Hitler Diaries" hoax===
The [[nadir]] of his career came in 1983, when as a director of ''[[The Times]]'', The [[Baron Dacre]] of Glanton, as he was by this point, "authenticated" the so-called ''[[Hitler Diaries]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title= Selling Hitler: The Extraordinary Story of the Con Job of the Century – The Faking of the Hitler "Diaries" |last= Harris |first= Robert |publisher= New York: Pantheon |date= 1986 |isbn= 9780394553368 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/sellinghitler00harr }}</ref> The opinion among experts in the field was by no means unanimous; [[David Irving]] for example, initially decried them as forgeries but subsequently changed his mind and declared that they could be genuine, before finally stating that they were a forgery.

Hugh Trevor-Roper was made a [[Life Peer|life peer]] in 1979 on the recommendation of [[Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref name="telegraph" /> He was raised to the [[British honours system|Peerage]] on 27 September 1979, and was introduced to the House of Lords as '''Baron Dacre of Glanton''', ''of [[Glanton]] in the [[County of Northumberland]]'';<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=47968 |date=2 October 1979 |page=12353}}</ref> he selected this title on the basis that "double-barrelled titles are an invention, and a monopoly, of [[Harold Wilson|Wilsonian]] peers", and being either 'Lord Trevor' or 'Lord Roper' was undesirable as "under the rules of the College of Arms either peerage title would require him to change his surname to either 'Trevor' or 'Roper.'" On mentioning the family's connection to the Dacre title to his wife, who liked the sound of it, Trevor-Roper was persuaded to opt for the title of "Baron Dacre", despite staunch opposition from the suo jure [[Rachel Douglas-Home, 27th Baroness Dacre|27th Baroness Dacre]] (née Brand).

Backhouse had portrayed Prince [[Ronglu]] as a friend of the West and an enemy of the Boxers when the opposite was true.<ref>Trevor-Roper, Hugh ''The Hermit of Peking'', New York: Alfred Knopf, 1976 page 268.</ref>

Trevor-Roper noted that in the "diary" of Ching Shan, which Backhouse claimed to have looted from Ching's house just before it was burned down by Indian troops in the [[Boxer Rebellion]], it has Prince Ronglu saying about the government's support of the Boxers: "''C'est pire qu'un crime, c'est une faute''" ("It was worse than a crime; it was a blunder.").<ref name="Trevor-Roper, Hugh page 203">Trevor-Roper, Hugh ''The Hermit of Peking'', New York: Alfred Knopf, 1976 page 203.</ref> Trevor-Roper argued that it was extremely unlikely that Prince Ronglu – who only knew Manchu and Mandarin – would be quoting a well-known French expression, but noted that Backhouse was fluent in French.<ref name="Trevor-Roper, Hugh page 203"/> Backhouse was fluent in [[Mandarin language|Mandarin]] and [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]], lived most of his life in Beijing and after moving to China had declined to wear western clothes, preferring instead the gown of a Chinese mandarin, which led most Westerners to assume that Backhouse "knew" China.

Trevor-Roper was a very firm "intentionist" who treated Hitler as a serious, if slightly deranged thinker who, from 1924 until his death in 1945, was obsessed with "the conquest of Russia, the extermination of the Slavs, and the colonization of the English".<ref>Cesarani, David "From Bullock to Kershaw: Some Peculiarities of British Historical Writing About the Nazi Persecution and Mass Murder of the Jews" page 339–354 from ''Holocaust Historiography In Context'' edited by David Bankier and Dan Michman, Jerusalem: Yad Vashem, 2008 page 345.</ref> In his 1962 essay "The Mind of Adolf Hitler", Trevor-Roper again criticized Bullock, writing "Even Mr.

He argued that the middle years of the 17th century in [[Western Europe]] saw a widespread break-down in politics, economics and society caused by demographic, social, religious, economic and political problems.<ref name="robinson" /> In this "general crisis,” various events, such as the [[English Civil War]], the ''[[Fronde]]'' in France, the climax of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Germany, troubles in the [[Netherlands]], and revolts against the Spanish Crown in [[Portugal]], [[Naples]] and [[Catalonia]], were all manifestations of the same problems.<ref name=autogenerated4>Rabb, Theodore K.''The Struggle for Stability in Early Modern Europe'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1975 page 18.</ref> The most important causes of the “general crisis” in Trevor-Roper's opinion were conflicts between “Court” and “Country”; that is between the increasingly powerful centralizing, bureaucratic, sovereign princely states, represented by the Court, and the traditional, regional, land-based aristocracy and gentry, representing the country.<ref name=autogenerated4 /> In addition, he said that the religious and intellectual changes introduced by the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the [[Renaissance]] were important secondary causes of the "general crisis."<ref name="robinson" />

The "general crisis" thesis generated controversy between supporters of this theory, and those, such as the Marxist historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]], who agreed with him that there was a "general crisis,” but saw the problems of 17th century Europe as more economic in origin than Trevor-Roper would allow.

In the 1950s, Trevor-Roper wrote that Braudel and the rest of the school were doing much innovative historical work but were "totally excluded from Oxford which remains, in historical matters, a retrograde provincial backwater".<ref name="Ascherson">{{cite magazine

===English Civil War===
In Trevor-Roper's opinion, the dispute between the [[Puritans]] and the [[Arminianism|Arminians]] was a major, although not the sole, cause of the [[English Civil War]].<ref name="robinson" /> For him, the dispute was over such issues as free will and predestination and the role of preaching versus the sacraments; only later did the dispute become a matter of the structure of the [[Church of England]].<ref name="robinson" /> The Puritans desired a more decentralised and egalitarian church, with an emphasis on the laity, while the Arminians wished for an ordered church with a hierarchy, an emphasis on divine right and salvation through free will.<ref name="robinson" />

As a historian of early modern Britain, Trevor-Roper was known for his disputes with fellow historians such as [[Lawrence Stone]] and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]], whose materialist (and in some measure "inevitablist") explanations of the [[English Civil War]] he attacked.

Bullock seems content to regard him as a diabolical adventurer animated solely by an unlimited lust for personal power...Hitler was a systematic thinker and his mind is, to the historian, as important as the mind of Bismarck or Lenin".<ref name="Cesarani page 339-354">Cesarani, David "From Bullock to Kershaw: Some Peculiarities of British Historical Writing About the Nazi Persecution and Mass Murder of the Jews" page 339–354 from ''Holocaust Historiography In Context'' edited by David Bankier and Dan Michman, Jerusalem: Yad Vashem, 2008 page 346.</ref> Trevor-Roper maintained that Hitler, on the basis of a wide range of antisemitic literature, from the writings of [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] to ''The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion'', had constructed a racist ideology that called for making Germany the world's greatest power and the extermination of perceived enemies like the Jews and Slavs.<ref name="Cesarani page 339-354"/>

Trevor-Roper wrote that the mind of Hitler was "a terrible phenomenon, imposing indeed in its granite harshness and yet infinitely squalid in its miscellaneous cumber, like some huge barbarian monolith; the expression of giant strength and savage genius; surrounded by a festering heap of refuse, old tins and vermin, ashes and eggshells and ordure, the intellectual detritus of centuries".<ref name="Cesarani page 339-354"/> Cesarani wrote that Trevor-Roper regarded Hitler, in marked contrast to Bullock, as a man who was serious about what he said but at the same time, Trevor-Roper's picture of Hitler as a somewhat insane leader, fanatically pursuing lunatic policies, meant paradoxically that it was hard to take Hitler seriously, at least on the basis of Trevor-Roper's writings.<ref>Cesarani, David "From Bullock to Kershaw: Some Peculiarities of British Historical Writing About the Nazi Persecution and Mass Murder of the Jews" page 339–354 from ''Holocaust Historiography In Context'' edited by David Bankier and Dan Michman, Jerusalem: Yad Vashem, 2008 pages 345–346.</ref> Cesarani stated that Trevor-Roper was sincere in his hatred and contempt for the Nazis and everything they stood for but he had considerable difficulty when it came to writing about the complicity and involvement of traditional German elites in National Socialism, because the traditional elites in Germany were so similar in many ways to the British Establishment, which Trevor-Roper identified with so strongly.

In this respect, Cesarani argued that it was very revealing that Trevor-Roper in ''The Last Days of Hitler'' was especially damning in his picture of the German Finance Minister, Count [[Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk|Lutz Schwerin von Krosigk]], whom Trevor-Roper noted "had been a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, but he had acquired none of its values".<ref name="ReferenceA">Cesarani, David "From Bullock to Kershaw: Some Peculiarities of British Historical Writing About the Nazi Persecution and Mass Murder of the Jews" page 339–354 from ''Holocaust Historiography In Context'' edited by David Bankier and Dan Michman, Jerusalem: Yad Vashem, 2008 page 352.</ref> Cesarani wrote "Thus, to Trevor-Roper the values of Oxford University stood at the opposite pole to those of Hitler's Reich, and one reason for the ghastly character of Nazism was that it did not share them".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Cesarani noted that while Trevor-Roper supported the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and ended his days as a Tory life-peer, he was broadly speaking a liberal and believed that Britain was a great nation because of its liberalism.<ref name="ReferenceB">Cesarani, David "From Bullock to Kershaw: Some Peculiarities of British Historical Writing About the Nazi Persecution and Mass Murder of the Jews" page 339–354 from ''Holocaust Historiography In Context'' edited by David Bankier and Dan Michman, Jerusalem: Yad Vashem, 2008 pages 352–353.</ref> Because of this background, Cesarani wrote that Trevor-Roper naturally saw the liberal democracy Britain as anathema to Nazi Germany.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Cesarani concluded "...to maintain the illusion of virtuous British liberalism, Hitler had to be depicted as either a statesman like any other or a monster without equal, and those who did business with him as, respectively, pragmatists or dupes.
