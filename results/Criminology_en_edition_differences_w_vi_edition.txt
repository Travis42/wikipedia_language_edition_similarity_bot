5. 
This period also saw many legal reforms, the [[French Revolution]], and the development of the [[Law of the United States|legal system in the United States]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Positivist school===
The [[Positivist school]] argues criminal behavior comes from internal and external factors out of the individual's control. 

6. 
 This results in [[social disorganization]], which reduces the ability of these institutions to control behavior and creates an environment ripe for [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]]. 

7. 
Stults stated, "As well as the results showed graduating high school represents an important developmental stage in American society, as it ends the compulsory education, and is often followed by a significant decline in daily need and extra resources from your parents."{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

====Subcultural theory====
{{Main|Subcultural theory}}
Following the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] and strain theory, and also drawing on [[Edwin Sutherland]]'s idea of [[differential association]], sub-cultural theorists focused on small cultural groups [[Fragmentation (sociology)|fragmenting]] away from the mainstream to form their own values and meanings about life. 

8. 
The Chicago School was a school of thought developed that blames social structures for human behaviors. 

9. 

====Psychoanalysis and the unconscious desire for punishment====
see main article [[Psychoanalytic criminology]]

[[Psychoanalysis]] is a psychological theory (and therapy) which regards the unconscious mind, [[repressed memories]] and [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], as the key drivers of behavior, especially deviant behavior.<ref name=":0">{{cite book|title=Beyond the Pleasure Principle|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|publisher=Broadview Editions|year=2011|isbn=|location=Peterborough, Ontario|pages=}}</ref> [[Sigmund Freud]] talks about how the unconscious desire for pain relates to psychoanalysis in his novel, ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle,''.<ref name=":0" /> Freud suggested that unconscious impulses such as ‘repetition compulsion’ and a ‘death drive’ can dominate a person's creativity, leading to self-destructive behavior.

===== Mass Murder =====
Mass murder is classified by the following characteristics:

# There are four or more victims in one general time frame
# The situation usually ends with the offender committing suicide

===== Spree Murder =====
Spree murder is classified by the following characteristics:

# No planning to occurrences
# Victims are unconnected strangers picked (mostly) at random
# Spree ends when killer is killed or put under arrest.

17. 
Its key method of thought is that criminals are born as criminals not made into them;{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} this school of thought also supports theory of nature in the debate between nature versus nurture.

==== More Classifications of Homicide ====
Homicide can either be '''expressive''' or '''instrumental'''

====Sociological positivism====
[[Sociological positivism]] suggests societal factors such as [[poverty]], membership of subcultures, or low levels of education can predispose people to crime. 

20. 
However, there are two types of laws:
*[[Natural law]]s are rooted in core values shared by many cultures. 

21. 
It differs from biological positivism in the thought that that school of thought says criminals are born criminals, whereas the psychological perspective recognizes the internal factors are results of external factor such as, but are not limited to, abusive parents, abusive relationships, drug problems, etc.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Social Positivism, which oftentimes referred to as Sociological Positivism, discusses the thought process that criminals are produced by society.

==== Multicides ====
Multicides, or the murder of multiple people, can be broken down into three different classifications: '''mass murder, spree murder,''' and '''serial murder'''.

==Criminological schools of thought==
[Thank you Anonym, um 1875.jpg|thumb|left|Three women in the [[pillory]], [[Ching China|China]], 1875]]

Serial murder is classified by the following characteristics:

# Involve multiple victims
# Occurrences take place on three separate occasions, characterized by cooling-off periods between each occurrence

=== Domestic Violence ===
Domestic violence usually occurs between a pair or partner of people, in the form of either familial violence or Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). 

28. 

==== Recording Domestic Violence ====
Recording domestic violence is usually dependent on victim reporting, therefore, statistics and numbers are usually an underestimate of reality.

Delinquency tends to occur among the lower-working-class males who have a lack of resources available to them and live in impoverished areas, as mentioned extensively by Albert Cohen (Cohen, 1965). 

33. 
[[Travis Hirschi]] identified four main characteristics: "attachment to others", "belief in moral validity of rules", "commitment to achievement", and "involvement in conventional activities".<ref>{{cite book |author=Hirschi, Travis |title=Causes of Delinquency |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=1969 |isbn=978-0-7658-0900-1}}</ref>  The more a person features those characteristics, the less likely he or she is to become deviant (or criminal).

When examined, they are left with the knowledge that they are not all the same, but come to a settlement of living together in the same space.<ref name=":2" /> Through it all, sociological perspective on cultural criminology theory attempts to understand how the environment an individual is in determines their criminal behavior.<ref name=":3" />

== Relative Deprivation Theory ==
[[Relative deprivation]] involves the process where an individual measures his or her own well-being and materialistic worth against that of other people and perceive that they are worse off in comparison.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Relative%2520Deprivation|title=Relative Deprivation definition {{!}} Psychology Glossary {{!}} alleydog.com|website=www.alleydog.com|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref> When humans fail to obtain what they believe they are owed, they can experience anger or jealousy over the notion that they have been wrongly disadvantaged.

From 1900 through to 2000 the study underwent three significant phases in the United States: (1) Golden Age of Research (1900-1930)-which has been described as a multiple-factor approach, (2) Golden Age of Theory (1930-1960)-which shows that there was no systematic way of connecting criminological research to theory, and (3) a 1960-2000 period-which was seen as a significant turning point for criminology.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Braithwaite|first=J.|date=2000-03-01|title=The New Regulatory State and the Transformation of Criminology|journal=British Journal of Criminology|volume=40|issue=2|pages=222–238|doi=10.1093/bjc/40.2.222|issn=0007-0955|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2892cc677ff50b05ba58958eeef143e14d392cc6}}</ref>

Criminologists are the people working and researching all of the ins and outs of criminology.

One of the main differences between this theory and Bentham's rational choice theory, which had been abandoned in criminology, is that if Bentham considered it possible to completely annihilate crime (through the [[panopticon]]), Becker's theory acknowledged that a society could not eradicate crime beneath a certain level.

====Routine activity theory====
{{Main|Routine activity theory}}
Routine activity theory, developed by Marcus Felson and Lawrence Cohen, draws upon control theories and explains crime in terms of crime opportunities that occur in everyday life.<ref>{{cite book |author=Felson, Marcus |title=Crime and Everyday Life |year=1994 |publisher=Pine Forge |isbn=978-0-8039-9029-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/crimeeverydaylif0000fels_u5u3 }}</ref> A crime opportunity requires that elements converge in time and place including a motivated offender, suitable target or victim, and lack of a capable guardian.<ref name="cohen">{{cite journal |author1=Cohen, Lawrence |author2=Marcus Felson |title=Social Change and Crime Rate Trends |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=44 |year=1979 |doi=10.2307/2094589 |pages=588–608 |issue=4 |jstor=2094589|citeseerx=10.1.1.476.3696 }}</ref> A guardian at a place, such as a street, could include security guards or even ordinary pedestrians who would witness the criminal act and possibly intervene or report it to law enforcement.<ref name="cohen" /> Routine activity theory was expanded by John Eck, who added a fourth element of "place manager" such as rental property managers who can take [[nuisance]] abatement measures.<ref>{{cite book |title=Reducing Crime and Drug Dealing by Improving Place Management: A Randomized Experiment |author1=Eck, John |author2=Julie Wartell |publisher=National Institute of Justice |year=1997}}</ref>

===Biosocial theories===
[[Biosocial criminology]] is an interdisciplinary field that aims to explain crime and antisocial behavior by exploring both biological factors and environmental factors.

====Social ecology====
Since the 1950s, social ecology studies have built on the social disorganization theories.

# 1st Degree Murder: This type of crime is also intentional, premeditated, and deliberated, although it is separate from capital murder in that it is usually less severe of a crime.

===Social structure theories===
This theory is applied to a variety of approaches within the bases of criminology in particular and in sociology more generally as a [[conflict theory]] or structural conflict perspective in sociology and sociology of crime.

Criminology is an interdisciplinary field in both the [[Behavioral sciences|behavioural]] and [[social science]]s, which draws primarily upon the research of [[sociology|sociologists]], [[psychology|psychologists]], [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]], [[biology|biologists]], [[social anthropology|social anthropologists]], as well as scholars of law.

It was later that Naegler and Salman introduced feminist theory to cultural criminology and discussed [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]], sexual attraction and sexuality, and intersectional themes.<ref name=":5">{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1557085116660609|year = 2016|url = http://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/37537/1/Naegler%2C%20Salman%20-%20Cultural%20Criminology%20and%20Gender%20Consciousness%20AAM.docx|title = Cultural Criminology and Gender Consciousness|journal = Feminist Criminology|volume = 11|issue = 4|pages = 354–374|last1 = Naegler|first1 = Laura|last2 = Salman|first2 = Sara}}</ref> Naegler and Salman believed that Ferrell's mold was limited and that they could add to the understanding of cultural criminology by studying women and those who do not fit Ferrell's mold.<ref name=":5" /> Hayward would later add that not only feminist theory, but green theory as well, played a role in the cultural criminology theory through the lens of adrenaline, the soft city, the transgressive subject, and the attentive gaze.<ref name=":2" /> The adrenaline lens deals with rational choice and what causes a person to have their own terms of availability, opportunity, and low levels of social control.<ref name=":2" /> The soft city lens deals with reality outside of the city and the imaginary sense of reality: the world where transgression occurs, where rigidity is slanted, and where rules are bent.<ref name=":2" /> The transgressive subject refers to a person who is attracted to rule-breaking and is attempting to be themselves in a world where everyone is against them.<ref name=":2" /> The attentive gaze is when someone, mainly an [[Ethnography|ethnographer]], is immersed into the culture and interested in lifestyle(s) and the symbolic, aesthetic, and visual aspects.

Therefore, definitions of crimes will vary from place to place, in accordance to the cultural norms and mores, but may be broadly classified as a [[blue-collar crime]], [[corporate crime]], [[organized crime]], [[political crime]], [[public order crime]], [[state crime]], [[state-corporate crime]], and [[white-collar crime]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} However, there have been moves in contemporary criminological theory to move away from [[liberal pluralism]], [[culturalism]], and [[postmodernism]] by introducing the universal term "harm" into the criminological debate as a replacement for the legal term "crime".<ref>Hillyard, P., Pantazis, C., Tombs, S., & Gordon, D.

They also conduct research and investigations, developing theories, and composing results, and often more than not solve crimes.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-criminology-974589|title=Criminology, the Study of Crime, Causes, and Consequences|last=Roufa|first=Timothy|website=The Balance Careers|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref>

The interests of criminologists include the study of nature of crime and criminals, origins of criminal law, etiology of crime, social reaction to crime, and the functioning of law enforcement agencies and the penal institutions. 

81. 
It can be broadly said that criminology directs its enquiries along three lines: first, it investigates the nature of criminal law and its administration and conditions under which it develops, second, it analyses the causation of crime and the personality of criminals; and third, it studies the control of crime and the rehabilitation of offenders.

Rawson]] used [[crime statistics]] to suggest a link between [[population density]] and [[crime rate]]s, with crowded cities producing more crime.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hayward, Keith J.

 They argued that punishment, if certain, swift, and proportionate to the crime, was a deterrent for crime, with risks outweighing possible benefits to the offender.

Becker, for example, acknowledged that many people operate under a high moral and ethical constraint but considered that criminals rationally see that the benefits of their crime outweigh the cost, such as the probability of apprehension and conviction, severity of punishment, as well as their current set of opportunities. 

86. 

With this perspective, [[crime prevention]] or reduction measures can be devised to increase the effort required to commit the crime, such as [[target hardening]].<ref name="clarke-1992">{{cite book |author=Clarke, Ronald V.

==Types and definitions of crime==
Both the positivist and classical schools take a consensus view of crime: that a crime is an act that violates the basic values and beliefs of society.
