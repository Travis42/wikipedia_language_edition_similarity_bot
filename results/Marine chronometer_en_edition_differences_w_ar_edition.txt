[[File:Chronometer of Jeremy Thacker.jpg|thumb|The marine "Chronometer" of [[Jeremy Thacker]] used [[gimbal]]s and a [[vacuum]] in a bell jar.]]
To determine a position on the Earth's surface, it is necessary and sufficient to know the [[latitude]], [[longitude]], and [[altitude]].

Sulli'', but neither his nor Thacker's models were able to resist the rolling of the seas and keep precise time while in shipboard conditions.<ref>[http://www.anthonygrayclocks.com/horological-timeline.htm A Chronology of Clocks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325173508/http://www.anthonygrayclocks.com/horological-timeline.htm |date=2014-03-25 }}</ref>

In 1714, the British government offered a [[longitude prize]] for a method of determining longitude at sea, with the awards ranging from £10,000 to £20,000 (£2 million to £4 million in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms) depending on accuracy. 

3. 
These quartz chronometers are not always the most accurate quartz clocks when no signal is received, and their signals can be lost or blocked. 

4. 
[[Thomas Mercer Chronometers]] still makes chronometers to the present day. 

5. 
Diamond was often used as the cap stone for the lower balance staff pivot to prevent wear from years of the heavy balance turning on the small pivot end. 

6. 
 During 1675 Huygens and Hooke each delivered two such devices to Charles, but none worked well and neither Huygens nor Hooke received an English patent. 

7. 
 It was during this work that Hooke formulated what is known as [[Hooke's Law]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0330532189|title=isbn:0330532189 - Google Search|author=|date=|website=books.google.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref>

The first published use of the term was in 1684 in ''Arcanum Navarchicum'', a theoretical work by Kiel professor Matthias Wasmuth. 

8. 
 To compensate for ever-changing spring strength, the majority of chronometer balances used bi-metallic strips to move small weights toward and away from the centre of oscillation, thus altering the period of the balance to match the changing force of the spring. 

9. 
 There are many constant-force and detached escapement designs, but the most common are the spring detent and pivoted detent. 

10. 
 On the return oscillation, a passing spring on the tip of the detent allows the unlocking roller on the staff to move by without displacing the detent. 

11. 
Until the 20th century, the best timekeepers were [[pendulum clock]]s, but both the rolling of a ship at sea and the up to 0.2% variations in the [[gravity of Earth]] made a simple gravity-based pendulum useless both in theory and in practice. 

12. 
 Around the turn of the 20th century, Swiss makers such as [[Ulysse Nardin]] made great strides toward incorporating modern production methods and using fully interchangeable parts, but it was only with the onset of [[World War II]] that the [[Hamilton Watch Company]] in the [[United States]] perfected the process of [[mass production]], which enabled it to produce thousands of its [[Hamilton Watch Company#Marine chronometers|Hamilton Model 21 and Model 22 chronometers]] of World War Two for the [[United States]] [[US Navy|Navy]] & [[United States Army|Army]] and other [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] navies. 

13. 
 The greatest strides toward practicality came at the hands of [[Thomas Earnshaw]] and [[John Arnold (watchmaker)|John Arnold]], who in 1780 developed and patented simplified, detached, "spring detent" [[escapement]]s,<ref name="landes">{{cite book| last = Landes| first = David S.| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Revolution in Time| publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press| year = 1983| location = Cambridge, Massachusetts| pages = [https://archive.org/details/revolutionintime00land_1/page/165 165]| url = https://archive.org/details/revolutionintime00land_1/page/165| doi = | id = | isbn = 0-674-76800-0| url-access = registration}} Pierre Le Roy had developed the detached spring detent escapement around 1748, but abandoned the concept.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F7wNQk219KMC&pg=PA349|title=Encyclopedia of Time|first=Samuel L.|last=Macey|date=19 March 1994|publisher=Taylor & Francis|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> moved the temperature compensation to the balance, and improved the design and manufacturing of [[balance spring]]s.

It was common for ships at the time to observe a [[time ball]], such as the one at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]], to check their chronometers before departing on a long voyage.

==Chronometer rating==
In strictly horological terms, "rating" a chronometer means that prior to the instrument entering service, the average rate of gaining or losing per day is observed and recorded on a rating certificate which accompanies the instrument.

Derham's principal work, ''Physico-theology, or a demonstration of the being and attributes of God from his works of creation'', also proposed the use of vacuum sealing to ensure greater accuracy in the operation of clocks.<ref>{{cite journal | last =Koberer | first =Wolfgang | title =Notes: On the First Use of the Term "Chronometer" | journal =The Mariner's Mirror | volume =102 | issue =2 | pages =203–205 | publisher =Society for Nautical Research | location =United Kingdom | date =May 2016 | doi=10.1080/00253359.2016.1167400}}</ref> Attempts to construct a working marine chronometer were begun by [[Jeremy Thacker]] in England in 1714, and by [[Henry Sully]] in France two years later. 

21. 

Marine chronometers always contain a [[maintaining power]] which keeps the chronometer going while it is being wound, and a [[power reserve]] to indicate how long the chronometer will continue to run without being wound. 

22. 

The term ''[[wikt:chronometer|chronometer]]'' was coined from the Greek words ''[[wikt:χρόνος|χρόνος]] (chronos)'' (meaning time) and ''[[meter]]'' (meaning measure) in 1714 by [[Jeremy Thacker]], an early competitor for the [[Longitude rewards|prize]] set by the [[Longitude Act]] in the same year.<ref>{{cite book | author = Sobel, Dava | authorlink = Dava Sobel | title = [[Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time]] | publisher = Penguin Books | pages = [https://archive.org/details/longitudetruest000sobe/page/56 56, 57] | isbn = 0-14-025879-5 | quote = Dismissing other solutions to the longitude problem, Thacker wrote "In a word, I am satisfied that my Reader begins to think that the ''Phonometers, Pyrometers, Selenometers, Heliometers'' and all the ''Meters'' are not worthy to be compared to my ''Chronometer''" }}</ref> It has recently become more commonly used to describe [[chronometer watch|watches tested and certified]] to meet certain precision standards.
