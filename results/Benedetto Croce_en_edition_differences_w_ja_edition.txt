Croce later coined the term ''onagrocrazia'' (literally "government by asses") to emphasize the anti-intellectual and boorish tendencies of parts of the Fascist regime.<ref>It is a disdainful term for misgovernment, a late and satirical addition to [[Aristotle]]'s famous three: [[tyranny]], [[oligarchy]], and democracy.</ref> However, in describing Fascism as anti-intellectual Croce ignored the many Italian intellectuals who at the time actively supported Mussolini's regime, including Croce's former friend and colleague, Gentile. 

22. 

In 1928, Croce voted against the law which effectively abolished free elections in Italy by requiring electors to vote for a list of candidates approved by the Grand Council of Fascism.<ref name="Rizi" /> He became increasingly dismayed by the number of ex-democrats who had abandoned their former principles.<ref name="Rizi" /> Croce frequently provided financial assistance to anti-Fascist writers and dissidents such as [[Giorgio Amendola]], [[Ivanoe Bonomi]], and [[Meuccio Ruini]], as well as those who wanted to maintain intellectual and political independence from the regime, and covertly helped them get published.<ref name="Rizi" /> Croce's house in Turin became a popular destination for anti-Fascists, and after the war, Amendola along with communists such as Eugenio Reale reflected that Croce offered aid and encouragement to both liberal and Marxist resistance members during the crucial years.<ref name="Rizi" />

Croce was seriously threatened by Mussolini's regime, though the only act of physical violence he suffered at the hands of the fascists was the ransacking of his home and library in Naples in November 1926.<ref>See the detailed description in a letter by Fausto Nicolini to Giovanni Gentile published in {{cite book |title=Per invigilare me stesso |first=Gennaro |last=Sasso |authorlink= |publisher=Il mulino |location=Bologna |year=1989 |isbn= |pages=139–40 |accessdate= |url=}}</ref> Although he managed to stay outside prison thanks to his reputation, he remained subject to surveillance, and his academic work was kept in obscurity by the government, to the extent that no mainstream newspaper or academic publication ever referred to him.

In short, his variety of liberalism is [[aristocracy|aristocratic]], as he views society being led by the few who can create the goodness of truth, civilization, and beauty, with the great mass of citizens, simply benefiting from them but unable to fully comprehend their creations (Ryn, 2000:xii).<ref name="lib"/>

In ''Etica e politica'' (1931), Croce defines liberalism as an ethical conception of life that rejects dogmatism and favors diversity, and in the name of liberty and free choice of the individual, is hostile to the authoritarianism of fascism, communism, and the Catholic Church.<ref name="Rizi">{{cite book |last1=Rizi |first1=Fabio Fernando |title=Benedetto Croce and Italian Fascism |date=2003 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |pages=124–139}}</ref> While Croce realizes that democracy can sometimes threaten individual liberty, he sees liberalism and democracy as predicated on the same ideals of moral equality and opposition to authority.<ref name="Rizi" /> Furthermore, he acknowledged the positive historic role played by the Socialist parties in Italy in their struggles to improve conditions for the working class, and urged modern socialists to swear off dictatorial solutions.<ref name="Rizi" /> In contrast to the socialists, who Croce viewed as part of modernity along with liberals, his condemnation of reactionaries is unremittingly harsh.<ref name="Rizi"/>

Croce also draws a distinction between liberalism and capitalism or ''laissez-faire'' economic doctrines.<ref name="Rizi"/> For Croce, capitalism only emerged to meet certain economic needs of society, and could be changed or even replaced if better solutions to those needs were found, if it failed to promote freedom, or if economic values clashed with higher values.<ref name="Rizi"/> Thus liberalism could welcome socialistic proposals so long as they promoted freedom.<ref name="Rizi"/> Croce's ideas on the separation between liberalism as an ethical principle and the contingent ''laissez-faire'' economic doctrines which accompanied it in certain contexts would influence Italian social democrats such as [[Leo Valiani]] and [[Giuseppe Saragat]] as well as the [[liberal socialist]] synthesis of [[Carlo Rosselli]].<ref name="Rizi"/>

==Philosophy of spirit==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
Heavily influenced by [[Hegel]] and other German Idealists such as [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], Croce produced what was called, by him, the Philosophy of Spirit.

This essay shows the Christian roots of European culture, but religion is considered by Croce a mere propaedeutic study for philosophy, which is the only true science: philosophy is, in fact, the science of spirit (the "Philosophy of Spirit"). 

27. 
In May 1925 Croce was one of the signatories to the [[Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals]] which had been written by Croce himself; however, in June of the previous year, he had voted in the Senate in support of the Mussolini government.
