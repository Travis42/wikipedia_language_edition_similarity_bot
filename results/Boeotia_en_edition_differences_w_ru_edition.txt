Boeotia

en edition's differences with the ru version: 


1. 

===Boeotian League===

About this time the Boeotian League comprised eleven groups of sovereign cities and associated townships, each of which elected one [[Boeotarch]] or minister of war and foreign affairs, contributed sixty delegates to the federal council at Thebes, and supplied a contingent of about 1000 infantry and 100 cavalry to the federal army. 

2. 
They rendered good service at [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] and at the [[Battle of Arginusae]] in the closing years of the Pelopennesian War; but their greatest achievement was the decisive victory at the [[Battle of Delium]] over the Athenian army (424 BC) in which both their heavy infantry and their cavalry displayed unusual efficiency.

===Fourth century BC===
Boeotia took a prominent part in the [[Corinthian War]] against Sparta, especially in the battles of [[Battle of Haliartus|Haliartus]] and [[Battle of Coronea (394 BC)|Coronea]] (395–394 BC). 

9. 
Also, according to legend the citizens of Thebes paid an annual tribute to their king [[Erginus]].<ref>''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheke]]'' 2.4.11 records the origin of the Theban tribute as recompense for the mortal wounding of [[Clymenus]], king of the Minyans, with a cast of a stone by a charioteer of [[Menoeceus]] in the precinct of Poseidon at Onchestus; the myth is also reported by [[Diodorus Siculus]], 4.10.3.</ref> The Minyans may have been [[Proto-Greek language|proto-Greek]] speakers, but although most scholars today agree that the [[Mycenean Greeks]] descended from the Minyans of the ''Middle Helladic period'', they believe that the progenitors and founders of [[Minyans|Minyan culture]] were an [[indigenous people|autochthonous]] group.<ref>{{harvnb|Cambitoglou|Descœudres|1990|p=7 under "Excavations in the Region of Pylos" by George S.

Many of them are related to the myths of [[Argos (Greece)|Argos]], and others indicate connections with [[Phoenicia]], where the Mycenean Greeks and later the [[Euboea|Euboean Greeks]] established trading posts.

But the outlying cities successfully resisted this policy, and only allowed the formation of a loose federation which, initially, was merely religious.<ref name=EB1911/>

While the Boeotians, unlike the [[Arcadia]]ns, generally acted as a united whole against foreign enemies, the constant struggle between the cities was a serious check on the nation's development.

==History==
[[File:Map of Boeotia.jpg|thumb|18th century map of ancient Boeotia.]]
[[File:Thebes-1.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of the Cadmeia, the central fortress of ancient [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]].]]

Boeotia had significant political importance, owing to its position on the north shore of the [[Gulf of Corinth]], the strategic strength of its frontiers, and the ease of communication within its extensive area. 

13. 
In about 519 BC, the resistance of [[Plataea]] to the federating policy of Thebes led to the interference of Athens on behalf of the former; on this occasion, and again in 507 BC, the Athenians defeated the Boeotian levy.

===Fifth century BC===

During the [[Persian Wars|Persian invasion]] of 480 BC, Thebes assisted the invaders.
