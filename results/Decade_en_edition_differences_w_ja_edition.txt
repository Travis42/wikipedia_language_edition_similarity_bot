Following this convention, a new decade begins when the tens digit of a numerical year changes (for example, the 1970s began when 19'''6'''9 ended and 19'''7'''0 began) while ending on the last day of any year ending in nine.

This method can also be used to describe any other period divided into decades, such as 'the 1st decade of the 1900s', or 'the fourth decade of life.'
