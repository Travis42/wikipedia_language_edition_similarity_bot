The knowledge of the whole [reality] is epistemologically impossible, although the effort of a [[cross-cutting knowledge], [[humanism-humanistic], of all parts of history, is required to anyone who truly wants to have a correct vision of the past.

The role of historical testimony changes: it remains at the center of the historian's concerns, but it is no longer the object, but is seen as a useful to build history, useful that can be obtained in any domain of knowledge.

At other times, the limitation of the field of study actually produces a '''historiographic genre''':

The historiographic genres

It may be noted that there are '''historiographic genres'' that participate in the story but may become more or less far from it: one end would be occupied by the grounds of the [[fiction]] occupied by the [historical novel]," whose unequal value does not tarnish its importance.

The introspection of German intellectuals in the face of their role in the face of Nazism and the nation's varying degrees of responsibility, the German people or ruling classes on the two [world wars] and the convulsive [interwar period] that witnessed the emergence of [Nazism] was the subject of the attention of historians of very different tendencies, such as [[Gerhard Ritter]] [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] or [Karl Diet Bracrichher].

AAP Archaeology Paleontology
In the case of the prehistoric period, the radical difference of [[documentary source]] and method (as well as the bureaucratic division of university [chair]] make it a very distant science from that of historians, especially when such sources and method are prolonged, giving primacy to the use of [[documentary source]] and the study of [[archaeological source-material culture]] in periods for which there is already [[documentary source-written sources]], and then speaking not of the [[ Prehistory]], but proper [archaeology] with its own journalizations [[classic archaeology]], [[medieval archaeology]], even [[industrial archaeology]]. 

52. 
For the case that serves as an example, contrast the sources of Bartholomew of the Houses with the other voices that were heard in the [[Board of Valladolid], among which he highlighted that of his rival [[John Ginés de Sepúlveda]], or even with the so-called "[vision of the vanquished]]",<ref>[[Leon Miguel-Portilla] Miguel LEON-PORTILLA], 1973.</ref> which is rarely preserved, but sometimes, as is the case with the Inca's ''New Chronicle and Good Government'' [[Felipe Guamán Poma de Ayala' Guaman Poma de Ayala]...<ref>The book of [Guaman Poma]] with his truly unique illustrations can be found online on the page of the Danish National Library: [http://www.kb.dk/elib/mss/poma/index-en.htm]</ref>

Reflection on the possibility or impossibility of an objective approach leads to the need to overcome opposition between [[objectivity]] (that of a non-existent "pure" science that is not contaminated with the scientist) and [[subjectivity]] (involved in interests, ideology and limitations of it) with the concept of intersubjectivity, which obliges to consider the task of the historian, as that of any scientist, as a social product, inseparable from the rest of the human [culture], in dialogue with other historians and with the society as a whole. 

53. 
The contribution to the contrary of [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] ''(The very relationship of the destruction of the Indies)'' was so momentous that it gave rise to the controversy of the [[board of Valladolid', which gave him a reply [[John Ginés de Sepúlveda]]; and even the so-called [Spanish Black Legend] Legend ne[gra]] when it was disseminated throughout Europe as anti-Spanish propaganda.

* the ''[Byzantine-Arabic Chronicle]]'' (741) and the ''[Mozarab Chronicle]]' (754), which precede a lost chronicle of the reign of [[Alfonso II of Asturias] Alfonso II]] and establish its continuity with those of [[Alfonso III of Asturias] Alfonso III]] at the end of the 'SIGLO' ('[Albeldense Chronicle]]', ''[Prophetic Chronicle]]', ''[Rotense Chronicle]]'' and ''[Sebastianense Chronicle]]'');

Historiography as a historiographic production

[[File:Cathedral and Indies Archive - Seville.jpg'thumbnail'right' [[Archive of Indies]], in front of [[Seville Cathedral]]]
[[File:Nazca-chauchilla-c05.jpg-miniature Burial of [[nazca culture]]]

Historiography is equivalent to every part of historiographic production, that is: the set of writings of [[historian]is about a particular historical subject or period.

Groupings of historians

Groups of historians who share methodology (and self-promote in conjunction with the powerful mechanism [[history magazine]-[quote]] sometimes arise around magazines, such as the French School of [[School of the Annales] Annales]] (see in this same article), english [[Past and Present]] or Italian [[Quaderni Storici]]; research groups or university professorships themselves, which are the pinnacle of the reproduction of historiographical [elites], through [political clientelism]] and recognition between [[peer review]] [[peer review]]. 

102. 
The so-called '[historians' [[historians']' of the 1980s among the philosopher [[J.Habermas]] (which supported the constant presence of Nazism) and historians such as [[Ernst Nolte]] and [[Joachim Fest]] [those who sought to distance themselves from "that past that does not pass" by analyzing such thorny issues as the [Holocaust] from a perspective that to their opponents seemed almost justified, equating Nazism and communism) presided over the 1980s, prior to the 1989 [German reunification].

Sometimes the etiquetting of the currents is the work of their detractors, so that historians in them typecastmays may or may not be satisfied with the way they are defined.

It is necessary to differentiate the two terms used above: "historiographic production" and "historical documentation", although in many cases it is a match that historians use the earlier historiographic production as historical documentation.

AAP Historical Subject (
In a more stated way, the ''historiographic currents'' usually express their methodology in a combative way, such as the [[Providenity]] of origin [Christianity] (not to be forgotten, that in addition to the Greek historiographical tradition of [[Herodotus]or [Tucydides], the origin of Western historiography is strongly linked to [[sacred history]), or the [Historical Materialism] of origin [[Marxist Marxism]] (which triumphed in European intellectual and university environments and American In the Middle of the XX-d-s-1-, falling numb at least since the fall of the [Berlin Wall]).

It was the center of a controversy that transcended the field of the historiographic to enter completely in the field of the political, very intense between 2004 and 2006, for the return to the [GeneralidCatalonia]] of the natives of this institution and other Catalans (the so-called [[historical memory', the Papers of Salamanca]), which can be considered as part of the simultaneous controversy surrounding the so-called recovery of [[historical memory]]. 

108. 
Classical journalization (see its justification in "[History- Division of Historical Time" Division of Historical Time]]) is debatable both by the need for transition periods and overlaps, and by not representing matching periods for all countries of the world (for which it has been accused of [Eurocentrism-Eurocentric]).

Medieval historiography is written mainly by [hagiography-hagigraphs]], [[chronist]]s, members of the episcopal [clergy] close to power, or by monks. 

110. 

Medieval and Modern Spanish Historiography
This was nothing new, and Spanish historiography is perhaps the most complete example of a secular effort to maintain the continuity of the written memory of the past, which he gave so good service from the medieval [Chronicle]that justified the [Reconquest], to strengthen the power of kings in the various Christian kingdoms. 

111. 
An intellectual approach that also does not contribute much to understanding historical science as such is the subordination of the philosophical point of view to historicality, considering all reality as the the product of a historical development: that would be the place of [historicism], a philosophical current that can be extended to other sciences, such as [geography].

With regard to the dissemination and publicity of historiographic production, it would be good if it met the same requirements as the others [[scientific publication].]

The term historiography is also used to speak of the group of historians of a nation, for example, in phrases similar to this: "Spanish historiography opened its arms and archives from the 1930s to the French and Anglo-Saxon [Hispanic-Hispanic]], who renewed their methodology".
