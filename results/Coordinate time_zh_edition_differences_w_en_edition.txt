How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

By convention, the coordinates of the events observed in the "Special Relativity" of the "Inertial Reference System" and "Inertial Observer" are the same as those observed by the "Original Time".

This description is of limited use because coordinates are defined at every point in the reference system, but imaginary observers and clocks selected for illustration have only a limited number of tracks to choose from.

The space-time coordinate system here implies that "the meaning of every imaginary space-time point is "the observer" is the "noteTag" in physics, a point that is calibrated by spatial coordinates and time coordinates is called "events (relativism) " ( events) , " (relativity) , events) ( relativity), and a collection of all events is called " space-time" .

To the observer, the clock appears to be stationary and has been used with the Einstein synchronisation, Einstein sync, Einstein sync, Einstein sync convention, corrected, synchronized with the observer's clock. 

21. 
For example, for the The observer must be infinitely far away from the solar system, so that the gravity of the solar system disappears where it is, and the observer must also be stationary relative to the centorofic ness of the solar system.

(tsl?en) Geocentric Coordinate Time, when the Earth's center of the earth, (TCG) is defined as a reference system that moves with the center of the earth (the center of the earth) and is, in principle, used for phenomena on earth and inside the Earth, such as the rotation of the Earth and the motion of the Earth." For the same reason as the Definition of TDB (The SI seconds of TCG are slightly faster than the SI seconds on the earth's surface clock, although the magnitude is much smaller than the previous), here is also defined as the scale version of the TCG, which is equal to SI seconds in the unit of the Earth Level.

To match the time and coordinates, you must keep the observer and clock at a standstill in the selected reference system (the <math>v?0 </math>) of the selected reference system, and be infinitely away from the gravity mass in the reference system (conditions that cannot be achieved in reality) so that the gravity bit of the system is at the observer's position of zero (the U-<math>-0 </math>). 

25. 
The person observing the physical event is called the observer, which is the observer and the observer, and the observer is modeled as the "mass point" that does not occupy any space, and that it carries an accurate clock (standard clock), the reading value of which is defined as the observer's . 

26. 

When a clock is placed where the reference system is nominally defined, the coordinates of the reference system cannot be measured: the clock at the center of the solar system cannot measure to the point of the system.

The coordinate timescales are s/he s/he s/he s/he s/he s/

Coordinate timescales are a kind of "time standard" designed to be used for the calculation of relativistic effects when needing to be taken into account coordinates. 

28. 
In many, but not all, coordinate systems, the occurrence of an instant, a place, of the event (relativity) of the event, can be calibrated by one time coordinate and three spatial coordinates.
