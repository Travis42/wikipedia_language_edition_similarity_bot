Milankovitch cycles

9 and 9 Jul, when it is detected by [[radar]] the proliferation of [[Meteor]] and the clouds of the [[meso]] layer that are related to the phenomenon of meteor.

Researchers recently realized this motion and the relative motion of Earth's orbit against the orbits of other planets. 

3. 
This problem is also referred to as ' ' ' caus' problem '. 

4. 

= = = Forwarding Problem = = =
The ' ' ' transition problem ' ' refers to the change in the frequency of climate variations 1 million years ago. 

5. 

Milankovitch theories on climate change work imperfections: In terms of specifics, the biggest changes are at a time scale of 100,000 years but the influence is relatively small at the time scale-see [[Glacial Period] for more information. 

6. 

= = = Issue 400 = = =
The ' 400,000 year ' issue is the variances of eccentricity that has a 400,000-year cycle. 

7. 
Some of the internal features of the climate system are considered to be sensitive to changes of illumination, to produce amplification of reactions with [[positive effects]] and suppress reactions with [[negative effects]]. 

8.

Since the earth spins around its axis and spins around the sun in orbit, several variable cycles take place. 

9. 

= = = Problem Stage 5 = = =
' The ' Phase 5 issue ' ' refers to the time period of the last stage during the period between the two glacial periods (during the 5-year Ocean bronze phase) which seemed to appear 10 thousand years before the effects of the sun being hypothesized was the birth of it. 

10. 
[[The fixed plane]] is the plane that symbolizes the [[angular pulse]] of the solar system, which is approximately the orbital plane of the [Jupiter | MoC Tinh]. 

11. 
This is also known as the ' Stage 11 ' ' issue, after the period between the glacial period in the [[[Positive State of the ocean]] 11 is not waiting if the 400,000 year cycle has an impact on the climate. 

12. 

= = = Issue 100 = = =

' ' 100,000 years ' ' problem is that variations of eccentricity have a significantly smaller effect on the effect of the sun compared to the wrong side or oblique and thus perhaps it produces the weakest effects. 

13. 
Note 20,000 year, 100,000 year, and 400.00 year cycles are clearly visible. 

14. 
This 100,000-year cycle is almost in line with the 100,000-year model of the glacial period.

16. 
The hemisphere that summer in the near-Japan will receive more radiation from the sun, but it will be winter at the far-reaching point and so the winter will be strangelyMore. 

17. 
For this reason the southern hemisphere season must tend to spread to a certain extent compared to the seasons of the northern hemisphere. 

18. 
Thus the difference between the seasons in the southern hemisphere to some extent is clearer than the northern hemisphere. 

19. 
When the tilt of the axis reaches 24.5 °, the winters become cooler and the summer becomes hotter than when the tilt is only 22.1 °. 

20. 
Changes in areas near the North Pole are considered important because a large amount of land reacts to such changes much faster than in the oceans. 

21. 

Currently the summer in the southern hemisphere takes place when the Earth is near the close-up and winter takes place when the Earth is near the far-reaching point. 

22. 
Astronomical calculations indicate that the summer radiation at 65 ° North has to rise gradually over the next 25,000 years and there is no summer radiation in 65 ° north to reduce strong enough to produce the glacial period within 50,000-100,000.M next. 

23. 

When the rotation axis is oriented so that it faces the sun in the near-Japanese point, a hemisphere will have a greater difference between the seasons while the other hemisphere will have more moderate seasons.

The effects of these variations are mainly considered due to variations in the intensity of solar irradiation on different parts of the globe.

The amount of solar radiation in the northern hemisphere at latitudes 65 ° North is considered to be related to the take-off of the glacial period. 

26. 

At present, the closest to the Sun's point (' ' ' in orbit is the # orbital point | The near Japanese]] ' ') and the most distant (' ' ' of the orbital distal point # trajectory "]") is just 3.4% (5.1 million km). 

27. 

The 1980 research of Imbrie is commonly cited and Imbrie has determined that the ' ' "Ignore artificial sources and other possible sources of influential variables at higher frequencies than an 19,000-year cycle, this model predicls that the long-term cooling tends to begin to take place about 6,000 years ago and will continue within the next 23,000 years." ' '

The recent works of Berger and Loutre show that the current warm climate can last for 50,000 years. 

28. 
Also, although the 100,000 year cycle is relatively large, some people still refued because they think the magnitude of the records on the climate are not large enough to be able to establish notable relationships in terms of statistics between climate and deviation Mind. 

29. 

= = Future = =

Orbital variables are predictable, so if there is a model that indicates the connection between orbital and climatic variables, we can run this model to "forecast" the climate in the future. 

30. 
There are two points to note: firstly, the artificial effects (such as [Global warming | The global warming]]) can produce major influences, at least short-term; and secondly, the mechanism by which the change in orbit affects the climate is still not well understood, yet a sufficiently consistent model proves the correlation between the climate and the orbital changes.

The rotation of the earth is fluctuating, with a slight change of about 2.4 °. 

33. 

At present, summers in the southern hemisphere take place when the Earth is roughly close to the near-Japanese and winter when the earth is within the span of the far-reaching point. 

34. 

Cooler summers will be a sign that the glacial period begins because the ice will dissolve less than the ice and snow generated from the previous winter. 

35. 
However, observations indicate that in the recent 1 million years the climate change is the biggest of the 100,000 years. 

36. 
The sufficiently large and accurate data on climate change needs to be able to split the transparency into both cycles, but so far all climate records indicate only 1 single cycle by 100 centuries.

The ' ' ' [[eccentricity] ' ' ' or the shape of Earth's orbit, roughly circular oscillations (small eccentricity, about 0.005) to moderate ellipse (large eccentricity, about 0.058), and an average eccentric rate of 0.028.
