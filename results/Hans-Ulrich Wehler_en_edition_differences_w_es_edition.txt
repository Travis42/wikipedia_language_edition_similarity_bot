Hans-Ulrich Wehler

en edition's differences with the es version: 


1. 
Wehler was ferocious in his criticism of Nolte and wrote several articles and books that by Wehler's own admission were polemical attacks on Nolte. 

2. 
From the Right, Otto Pflanze claimed that Wehler's use of such terms as "Bonapartism", "social imperialism", "negative integration" and ''Sammlungspolitik'' ("the politics of rallying together") has gone beyond mere heuristic devices and instead become a form of historical fiction.<ref name="Hamerow, Theodore S 1983, page 68">Hamerow, Theodore S. 

3. 
 The fifth volume will extend to 1990; none of the series has yet been translated into English.<ref>A partial summary appears in Hans-Ulrich Wehler, ''The German Empire, 1871-1918'' (1997)</ref>

From the 1980s, however, the Bielefeld school was increasingly challenged by proponents of the "cultural turn" for not incorporating culture in the history of society, for reducing politics to society, and for reducing individuals to structures. 

4. 
Wehler is one of the foremost advocates of the "Berlin War Party" historical school, which assigns the sole and exclusive responsibility for [[World War I]] to the German government. 

5. 
 Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernizing society.

7. 
Wehler places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s-1870s, when economic modernization took place, but political modernization failed to take place and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service. 

8. 
</ref> As a result, the economic sphere was modernized and the social sphere partially modernized.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Politically, in Wehler's opinion, the new unified Germany retained values that were aristocratic and feudal, anti-democratic and pre-modern.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In Wehler's view, the efforts of the reactionary German élite to retain power led to the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914, the failure of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the coming of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Wehler has especially criticised what he terms [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s strategy of "negative integration"—by which Bismarck sought to create a sense of ''Deutschtum'' (Germanism) and to consolidate his power by subjecting various minority groups (such as Roman Catholics, Alsatians, Poles, and Social Democrats) to discriminatory laws. 

9. 
The traditional focus on individuals was inverted into a modern focus on structures, and traditional emphatic understanding was inverted into modern causal explanation.<ref>Chris Lorenz, "'Won't You Tell Me, Where Have All the Good Times Gone'.

11. 
He was one of the more famous proponents of the ''[[Sonderweg]]'' (Special Path) thesis that argues Germany in the 19th century underwent only partial [[modernization]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Wehler has argued that [[Germany]] was the only nation to be created in Western Europe through a military "revolution from above", which happened to occur at the same time that the agricultural revolution was fading and the [[Industrial Revolution]] was beginning in [[Central Europe]].<ref name="Hamerow, Theodore S 1983, page 67">

==Criticism==
Wehler's work has been criticized. 

14. 
"Guilt, Redemption and Writing German History" pages 53-72 from ''The American Historical Review'', February 1983, Volume 88 page 71</ref> In Blackbourn and Eley's view, there was no ''Sonderweg'', and it is ahistorical to ask why Germany did not become Britain for the simple reason that Germany is Germany and Britain is Britain.<ref name="Hamerow, Theodore S 1983, page 71"/> Moreover, Eley and Blackbourn argued that after 1890 there was a tendency towards greater democratization in German society with the growth of civil society as reflected in the growth of trade unions and a more or less free press.<ref name="Hamerow, Theodore S 1983, page 71"/>

In addition, Eley contends that there are three flaws in Wehler's theory of [[social imperialism]]. 

15. 

In a 2006 interview, Wehler supported the imprisonment of [[David Irving]] for [[Holocaust Denial]] in Austria on the grounds that "The denial of such an unimaginable murder of millions, one third of whom were children under the age of 14, cannot simply be accepted as something protected by the freedom of speech".<ref>{{cite web

Wehler accepted this honor with some reluctance as previous German historians so honored have included [[Leopold von Ranke]], [[Gerhard Ritter]] and [[Friedrich Meinecke]], none of whom Wehler considers proper historians.

Wehler specialised in research into the [[Second Reich]]. 

21. 

Wehler sees the aggressive foreign policies of the [[German Empire]], especially under Kaiser [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]], largely as part of an effort on the part of the government to distract the German people from the lack of internal [[democracy]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> This ''{{lang|de|Primat der Innenpolitik}}'' ("primacy of domestic politics") argument to explain foreign policy, for which Wehler owes much to the work of [[Eckart Kehr]], places him against the traditional ''{{lang|de|Primat der Außenpolitik}}'' ("primacy of foreign politics") thesis championed by historians such as [[Gerhard Ritter]], [[Klaus Hildebrand]],  [[Andreas Hillgruber]], and Ludwig Dehio.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Wehler advocates the concept of [[Social-imperialism|social imperialism]], which he has defined as "the diversions outwards of internal tensions and forces of change in order to preserve the social and political status quo", and as a "defensive ideology" to counter the "disruptive effects of industrialization on the social and economic structure of Germany".<ref name="ReferenceB">

Wehler's ''Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte,'' (1987- ) is a comprehensive 5-volume history of German society in the 18th-20th centuries. 

23. 
Volume 3 ''Von der "Deutschen Doppelrevolution" bis zum Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges 1849-1914'' (1995) employs Wehler's longtime emphasis on a German ''Sonderweg'' or "special path" as the root of Nazism and the German catastrophe in the 20th century.

==Bielefeld School==
Wehler is a leader of the so-called Bielefeld School, a group of historians who use the methods of the [[social sciences]] to analyze history.<ref name="ReferenceA">Lorenz, Chris "Wehler, Hans-Ulrich" pages 1289–1290 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', Volume 2 page 1289</ref>

Social history developed within West German historiography during the 1950s-60s as a successor to the national history discredited by [[National Socialism]].

29. 
"Guilt, Redemption and Writing German History" pages 53-72 from ''The American Historical Review'', February 1983, Volume 88 page 68</ref> The German conservative historian [[Thomas Nipperdey]] has argued that Wehler presented German elites as more united than they were, focused too much on forces from above and not enough on forces from below in 19th-century German society, and presented too stark a contrast between the forces of order and stabilization versus the forces of democracy with no explanation for the relative stability of the Empire.<ref name="Hamerow, Theodore S 1983, page 68"/> In Nipperdey's opinion, Wehler's work fails to explain how the [[Weimar Republic]] occurred, since, according to Wehler, prior to 1918 the forces of authoritarianism were so strong and those of democracy so weak.<ref name="Hamerow, Theodore S 1983, page 68"/> In a 1975 book review of Wehler's ''Das Deutsche Kaiserreich'', Nipperdey concluded that a proper history of the Imperial period could only be written by placing German history in a comparative European and trans-Atlantic perspective, which might allow for "our fixation on the struggle with our great-grandfathers" to end.<ref name="Hamerow, Theodore S 1983, page 68"/>

From the Left, Wehler has been criticized by two British Marxist historians, [[David Blackbourn]] and [[Geoff Eley]] who in their 1980 book ''Mythen deutscher Geschichtsschreibung'' (translated into English in 1984 as ''The Peculiarities of German History'') rejected the entire concept of the ''Sonderweg'' as a flawed construct supported by "a curious mixture of idealistic analysis and vulgar materialism" that led to an "exaggerated linear continuity between the nineteenth century and the 1930s".<ref name="Hamerow, Theodore S 1983, page 71">Hamerow, Theodore S. 

30. 
In his 1988 book about the ''Historikerstreit'' entitled ''Entsorgung der deutschen Vergangenheit?: ein polemischer Essay zum "Historikerstreit"'' (''Exoneration of the German Past?: A Polemical Essay about the 'Historikerstreit'''), in which Wehler criticized every aspect of Nolte's views, and in which Wehler called the ''Historikerstreit'' a "political struggle" for the historical understanding of the German past between "a cartel devoted to repressing and excusing" the memory of the Nazi years, of which Nolte was the chief member, against "the representatives of a liberal-democratic politics, of an enlightened, self-critical position, of a rationality which is critical of ideology".<ref>Muller, Jerry "German Historians At War" from ''Commentary'' page 40.</ref> Besides Nolte, Wehler also attacked the work of [[Michael Stürmer]] as  "a strident declaration of war against a key element of the consensus upon which the socio-political life of this second republic has rested heretofore"<ref>Muller, Jerry "German Historians At War" pages 33-42 from ''Commentary'', Volume 87, Issue #5, May 1989 page 38</ref> During the ''Historikerstreit'', Wehler was one of the few historians who endorsed [[Jürgen Habermas]]'s method of attacking [[Andreas Hillgruber]] by creating a sentence about "tested senior officials in Nazi Party in the East" out of a long sentence in which Hillgruber had said no such thing on the grounds that it was a secondary issue of no real importance.<ref name="Evans, Richard pages 159-160">Evans, Richard ''In Hitler's Shadow'', New York : Pantheon Books, 1989 pages 159-160</ref> The British historian [[Richard J. 

31. 
 The German brand of "history of society"—''Gesellschaftsgeschichte''—has been known from its beginning in the 1960s for its application of sociological and political modernization theories to German history. 

32. 
Modernization theory was presented by Wehler and the Bielefeld School as the way to transform "traditional" German history, that is, national political history, centered on a few "great men," into an integrated and comparative history of German society encompassing societal structures outside politics. 

33. 
and was strongly influenced by its academic structures and by research in comparative modernization.<ref>Daum (2000)</ref>

Wehler taught at the [[University of Cologne]] (1968–70), at the [[Free University of Berlin]] (1970–71) and at [[Bielefeld University]] (1971–96).<ref>Lorenz, Chris "Wehler, Hans-Ulrich" pages 1289–1290 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', Volume 2 page 1290</ref>

Wehler and his colleagues [[Jürgen Kocka]] and Reinhart Koselleck founded the Bielefeld School of historical analysis. 

34. 
The first is that Wehler credits leaders such as Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] and Prince [[Bernhard von Bülow]] with a greater degree of vision than they in fact possessed.<ref>Eley, Geoff "Social Imperialism" pages 925-926 from ''Modern Germany'' Volume 2, New York, Garland Publishing, 1998 pages 925-926.</ref> The second is that many of the right-wing pressure groups who advocated an imperialist policy for Germany were not government creations, and in fact often demanded far more aggressive policies then the government was willing to undertake.<ref name="Eley pages 925-926">Eley, Geoff "Social Imperialism" pages 925-926 from ''Modern Germany'' Volume 2, New York, Garland Publishing, 1998 page 926.</ref> The third was that many of the groups advocating imperialism demanded a policy of political and social reform at home to complement imperialism abroad.<ref name="Eley pages 925-926"/> Eley argued that what is required in thinking about social imperialism is a broader picture with an interaction between above and below, and a wider view of the relationship between imperialism abroad and domestic politics.<ref name="Eley pages 925-926"/>

==Later career==
During the "Goldhagen Controversy" of 1996, Wehler was a leading critic of [[Daniel Goldhagen]], especially in regards to the latter's claims in his book ''[[Hitler's Willing Executioners]]'' about an alleged culture of murderous German "eliminationist anti-Semitism", though Wehler was more sympathetic towards Goldhagen's claims concerning the motives of Holocaust perpetrators.<ref>Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of interpretation'', London: Arnold 2000 pages 258-259.</ref> The Canadian historian Fred Kautz called Wehler an anti-Semite for his attacks on Goldhagen.<ref>Kautz, Fred ''The German Historians Hitler's Willing Executioners and Daniel Goldhagen'', Montreal: Black Rose Books, 2003 page 80</ref> Kautz wrote that "He [Wehler] doesn't dare say it openly that he thinks Goldhagen is incapable of writing about the Holocaust because he is a Jew...It's flabbergasting what perverse ideas are dreamt up in the studies of German professors, where according to an ancient legend, one seeks the truth unperturbed, "sine ira et studio" ("with diligence and without anger"): the victims of history should not be allowed to write their own history!"<ref>Kautz, Fred ''The German Historians Hitler's Willing Executioners and Daniel Goldhagen'', Montreal: Black Rose Books, 2003 pages 80-81</ref>

In 2000, Wehler became the eighth German historian to be inducted as an honorary member of the [[American Historical Association]].
