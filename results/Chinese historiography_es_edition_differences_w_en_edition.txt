Chinese historiography

es edition's differences with the en version: 


1. 
For example, they tend to question the questions themselves, questioning the assumptions that a question entails before answering it. 

2. 
To say that China has not fundamentally changed is a [[tautology], because you simply have to look for things that have not changed and define them as fundamental. 

3. 

An example of how fruitful the questioning of assumptions results comes from questioning whether China was weak in the 19th century, to realize the fact that during that alleged weakness its borders were spreading to points never before reached in [[Central Asia]]. 

4. 
If, on the contrary, every dynasty has not seen itself as a legitimate holder of the ''Command of Heaven'', what legitimized it in the [[dynastic cycle], beyond social or ethnic origin, was the moral integrity and benevolent leadership that the same ''Command of Heaven'' had been validating. 

5. 
Appreciating as part of it the dynasties have not, as the [Yuan Dynasty' Yuan]] [[Mongol (ethnic)-Mongolian] and [[Qing]] [manchu], it is supposed to reduce the [alienation] of [[ethnic minorities]] living within China. 

6. 
To use an analogy, it would be like classifying all animals into two groups: fish and "no fish", which would make such a classification very unhelpful, by putting spiders and mountain goats together. 

7. 
Placing the Tang as initiators of the bureaucratic phase is done on the basis of the system of [[imperial examinations]] which ended up becoming the [[nine-ranking system]]; although previously both systems were in use. 

8. 

The Three Stadiums of the Revolution

[[Kuomintang] developed his own theory of political stadiums based on [Sun Yatsen]'s proposals, and limited to the most recent history:

* Military unification - 1923 - 1928 ([[North Expedition]])
* political guardianship - 1928 - 1947
* Constitutional Democracy - 1947 onwards ([[Republic of China]], territorially limited to [[Taiwan]])

The most obvious critique is the almost identical nature of the last two stadiums, which consisted of a single-match regime until the 1990s. 

9. 
China (including its [[vasal]]s/[[Tax]]s internal) is seen as a coherent [state]], formed from [[time immemorial time]], and exists as a legal entity even in periods of political disunity. 

10. 
A new concept, popularized by [John Fairbank] was the notion of ''change within tradition'', which argued that although China changed in the premodern period, that change existed within certain cultural traditions. 

11. 
It cannot be argued, from modern ethnic and racial terminology, that the peoples of present-day North and South Asia - and parts of Central and South-East Asia - have thought of themselves as part of a large, central China-centered world for such a long period (the entire period before European potenties destroyed this imaginative cosmological construction). 

12. 
Some analysts of world systems (the theory of [the [world system], seeking the origin of the cycles [[Kondratiev]]) point out that capitalism first emerged during the [Song dynasty]. 

13. 

The Convergence Theory
It is a broad term that includes the views of non-Marxist Chinese intellectuals of the mid-20th century, such as the involution theory of [[Hu Shih]] and [Ray Huang]]. 

14. 
According to this vision, which can be called [Easternism], Asian societies (India, China, and the Middle East) may have had a glorious past, but their problem was just being trapped in that [static past]]. 

15. 
The Dynasties [[Yuan Dynasty' Yuan]] and [[Qing]] (which could be considered foreign, as the imperial families did not belong to the Han ethnic group) faithfully fulfilled the tradition, writing respectively the official stories of the [[Song]] and [Ming] dynasties (dominated by the Han). 

16. 
In the long run, the dynasty weakens so much that its replacement was possible for a new dynasty. 

17. 
For example, it has been a Chinese tradition since the [Jin dynasty] ([3rd century]) that the emperors of each dynasty sponsored the drafting of the official history of the immediately present dynasty, which usually involved a monumental intellectual task. 

18. 
Some focus on the definition of traditional society, which would simply be a wild card that would encompass any non-Western society implying that all of them are similar. 

19. 
However, this political restriction is less restrictive than it might seem at first glance, given that historical materialism (like any paradigm) is surprisingly flexible, and the ability of historians sufficient to modify it in alternative historical theories using a language that does not challenge official interpretation. 

20. 
So, for example, before answering the question 'Why didn't China develop modern science and capitalism?'' should be answered by ''Why do we assume that what China developed was not modern science and capitalism?'' In this way we come to question what are the essential characteristics of both concepts, and whether it makes any sense to apply European concepts to Chinese history.
