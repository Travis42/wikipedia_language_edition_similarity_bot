4. 
Spencer found attestations of ''altjira'' from the 1890s that used the word to mean "associated with past times" or "eternal", not "god".{{sfn|Gill|1998|pp=93–103}}

Academic Sam Gill finds Strehlow's use of ''Altjira'' ambiguous, sometimes describing a supreme being and sometimes describing a totem being, but not necessarily a supreme one. 

5. 
* [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]] says that aspects of his [[cartoon]]/[[fantasy]] epic ''[[Bone (comic)|Bone]]'' were inspired by Dreamtime, among other things.{{sfn|Smith|loc=Bone–A–Fides section}}
* [[Queenie Chan]]'s manga [[The Dreaming (manga)|''The Dreaming'']] (2005) takes place in [[Australia]] and deals with students from a boarding school who mysteriously go missing. 

6. 
* [[Sandra McDonald]]'s novels, ''The Outback Stars'', ''The Stars Down Under'' and ''The Stars Blue Yonder'' (2007–2009), use Aboriginal myth extensively. 

7. 
In another example, the ''[[Gagudju]]'' people of [[Arnhemland]], for which [[Kakadu National Park]] is named, believe that the sandstone escarpment that dominates the park's landscape was created in the Dreamtime when ''Ginga'' (the crocodile-man) was badly burned during a ceremony and jumped into the water to save himself.{{cn|date=December 2019}}

An early reference is found is [[Richard McKenna]]'s 1960s speculative fiction novella, ''[[Fiddler's Green (1967 novelette)|Fiddler's Green]]'', which mentions "Alcheringa... 

8. 
* [[Tuomas Holopainen]]'s 2014 album ''[[Music Inspired by the Life and Times of Scrooge]]'' includes a track entitled "Dreamtime," which directly references the Scrooge McDuck comic ''[[Dreamtime Duck of the Never-Never]]'', and includes a [[didgeridoo]] in its instrumentation.

In this way, "[[songline]]s" (or ''Yiri'' in the [[Warlpiri language]]) were established, some of which could travel right across Australia, through as many as six to ten different language groupings. 

11. 
"The native," they concluded, "knows nothing of 'dreamtime' as a designation of a certain period of their history."{{sfn|Hill|2003|pp=140–141}}{{efn|The Strehlows' informant, Moses (''Tjalkabota''), was a convert to Christianity, and the adoption of his interpretation suffered from a methodological error, according to [[Barry Hill (Australian writer)|Barry Hill]], since his conversion made his views on pre-contact beliefs unreliable.}}

Strehlow gives ''Altjira'' or ''Altjira mara'' (''mara'' meaning "good") as the Arrente word for the eternal [[Creator deity|creator]] of the world and humankind. 

12. 
The meaning and significance of particular places and creatures is wedded to their origin in The Dreaming, and certain places have a particular potency or Dreaming. 

13. 
In Strehlow's account, ''Altjira'' lives in the sky (which is a body of land through which runs the [[Milky Way]], a river).{{sfn|Gill|1998|pp=93–103}}

However, by the time Strehlow was writing, his contacts had been converts to Christianity for decades, and critics suggested that ''Altjira'' had been used by missionaries as a word for the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]].{{sfn|Gill|1998|pp=93–103}}

In 1926, Spencer conducted a field study to challenge Strehlow's conclusion about ''Altjira'' and the implied criticism of Gillen and Spencer's original work. 

14. 

"[[Dreaming (spirituality)|Dreaming]]" is now also used as a term for a system of totemic symbols, so that an Aboriginal person may "own" a specific "Dreaming", such as Kangaroo Dreaming, Shark Dreaming, Honey Ant Dreaming, Badger Dreaming, or any combination of Dreamings pertinent to their country.

He may also regard tribal law as his Dreaming."

In the [[Wangga]] genre, the songs and dances express themes related to death and regeneration.{{sfn|Marett|2005|p=1}} They are performed publicly with the singer composing from their daily lives or while Dreaming of a ''nyuidj'' (dead spirit).{{sfn|Povinelli|2002|p=200}}

Dreaming stories vary throughout Australia, with variations on the same theme.

With [[Walter Baldwin Spencer]], Gillen published a major work, ''Native Tribes of Central Australia'', in 1899.{{sfn|James|2015|p=36}} In that work, they spoke of the ''Alcheringa'' as "the name applied to the far distant past with which the earliest traditions of the tribe deal".{{sfn|Spencer|Gillen|1899|p=73 n.1,645}}{{efn|"the dim past to which the natives give the name of the 'Alcheringa'." (p.119)}} Five years later, in their ''Northern tribes of central Australia'', they gloss the far distant age as "the dream times", link it to the word ''alcheri'' meaning "dream", and affirm that the term is current also among the [[Kaytetye people|Kaitish]] and [[Anmatyerre|Unmatjera]].{{sfn|Spencer|Gillen|1904|p=745}}

=== Altjira ===
Early doubts about the precision of Spencer and Gillen's English gloss were expressed by the German [[Lutheran]] pastor and missionary [[Carl Strehlow]] in his 1908 book ''Die Aranda'' ("The [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]]"), who noted that his Arrente contacts explained ''altjira'', whose etymology was unknown, as an eternal being who had no beginning.
