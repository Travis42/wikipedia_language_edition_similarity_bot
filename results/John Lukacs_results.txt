Lukacs argues that although [Joseph Stalin] is primarily responsible for its inception, it was the presidency of [Dwight Eisenhower]that squandered the opportunity to finish it in 1953 after Joseph Stalin's death, which unnecessarily prolonged it over the next few decades

<ref>Lukacs, John ''The Hitler of History'' New York: Vintage Books, 1997, 1998 page 133</ref> Lukacs argues that Hitler's reason for the invasion was therefore the real one: England would not surrender because Churchill maintained the hope that the Soviet Union would enter the war with the Allies, leaving Germany no choice but to eliminate that hope; many historians have argued that such a reason was only a pretext

Lukacs argued that the best [form of government] is that of a [[elite]][illustrated], preferably a [Catholic].] A main theme of his work has consisted of assertions of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] (French author of the nineteenth century, whose main work is ''[Democracy in America]', 1835-1844) in which he suggested that all [state]s, were [[monarchy]]s or [[republic]s, had been dominated by elites [[aristocratic]]s, and that the age of aristocratic elites was coming to an end; instead would be beginning the era of the [democratic] elites, which would reflect the interests and concerns of [masses]

Lukacs sees himself as an advocate of the ''traditional values of [Western civilization]' against what he sees as the destroyers equal effects of modern [[civ]mass ilization]] ('see [[elitism]], [[civilization]], [[modernity]], [[modernization]], [[pre-industrial society]], [[industrial society]], [[post-industrial society]], [[mass culture]], [[José Ortega y Gasset]]'' —[The rebellion of the masses]], 1930

Although Lukacs argues that Britain alone could not defeat Germany, and that the primary responsibility lay with the United States and the Soviet Union, he points out that in the decisive year of 1940 Churchill managed to ensure that Germany would not win the war, laying the foundationfor the subsequent Allied victory

<ref>Lukacs, John ''The Hitler of History'' New York: Vintage Books, 1997, 1998 pages 149-151</ref> At the same time, Lukacs has been one of [Viktor Suvorov's] main critics, attacking The Latter's idea of considering Operation Barbarossa as a "[preventive war]" which Germany was forced by the aggression of [Joseph Stalin], which Suvorov said was planning to attack Germany only a little later than the summer of 1941

The theme of the rise of populism and the decline of elitism is also that of Lukacs's only novel ('A Thread of Years'', 1998), containing a set of vignettes for each year of the twentieth century (until 1998) in which he traces what the author considers the collapse of the '[value (axiology)]] [[traditional]] is Americans' (i.e., Americans) of gentlemanly and educated conduct, in the face of the profane and vulgar of ''modern American culture''

For Lukacs, the [Operation Barbarossa] (German invasion of the Soviet Union) was not inspired by [anti-communism] or any long-term plan for the conquest of territories, as suggested by historians such as [Andreas Hillgruber]] (who proposed that Hitler had a 'stufenplan'' (a step-by-step plan) but rather was an ad hoc reaction to which Hitler was forced, given the British refusal to surrender in 1940-41
