How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

== Radiocarbon calibration ==
{{main|Radiocarbon dating#Calibration}}
Dates determined using radiocarbon dating come in two kinds: ''uncalibrated'' (also called ''Libby'' or ''raw'') and ''calibrated'' (also called ''Cambridge'') dates.<ref name="Archaeology">{{Cite book | last=Greene | first=Kevin | authorlink=Kevin Greene (archaeologist)| title=Archaeology: An Introduction | year=2002 | publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press | location=Philadelphia | isbn=0-8122-1828-0 | pages=165–167}}</ref> 
''Uncalibrated'' radiocarbon dates should be clearly noted as such by "uncalibrated years BP", because they are not identical to calendar dates.

Such calibrated dates are expressed as cal BP, where "cal" indicates "calibrated years", or "calendar years", before 1950.

==Usage==
The BP scale is sometimes used for dates established by means other than radiocarbon dating, such as [[stratigraphy]].<ref name="AGUStyle">{{cite web

== Radiocarbon dating ==
Radiocarbon dating was first used in 1940.

Because the "present" time changes, standard practice is to use 1 January 1950 as the commencement date ([[epoch]]) of the age scale,{{efn|Unlike other [[era]]s, the sense "After Present" (AP) is never used.}} reflecting the origin of practical [[radiocarbon dating]] in the 1950s.
