How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.

Unless the econometrician controls for place of birth in the above equation, the effect of birthplace on wages may be falsely attributed to the effect of education on wages.

If the researcher could randomly assign people to different levels of education, the data set thus generated would allow estimation of the effect of changes in years of education on wages.

Econometrics may use standard [[statistical model]]s to study economic questions, but most often they are with [[observational study|observational]] data, rather than in [[experiment|controlled experiments]].<ref name=Introductory_econometrics>{{cite book |last=Wooldridge |first=Jeffrey |date=2013 |title=Introductory Econometrics, A modern approach |url= |location= |publisher=South-Western, Cengage learning |page= |isbn=978-1-111-53104-1}}</ref> In this, the design of observational studies in econometrics is similar to the design of studies in other observational disciplines, such as astronomy, epidemiology, sociology and political science. 

10. 
Given this kind of data, the estimated coefficient on Years of Education in the equation above reflects both the effect of education on wages and the effect of other variables on wages, if those other variables were correlated with education. 

11. 
Consequently, the field of econometrics has developed methods for [[parameter identification problem|identification]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]] of [[simultaneous equation methods (econometrics)|simultaneous-equation models]]. 

12. 
These methods are analogous to methods used in other areas of science, such as the field of [[system identification]] in [[systems analysis]] and [[control theory]].

==Theory==
{{see also|Estimation theory}}
Econometric theory uses [[statistical theory]] and [[mathematical statistics]] to evaluate and develop econometric methods.<ref name="Greene Econometrics – mathematical statistics and statistical theory" /><ref name="Wooldridge Econometrics – mathematical statistics" /> Econometricians try to find [[estimator]]s that have desirable statistical properties including [[Bias of an estimator|unbiasedness]], [[Efficiency (statistics)|efficiency]], and [[Consistent estimator|consistency]]. 

15. 
The variance in a prediction of the dependent variable (unemployment) as a function of the independent variable (GDP growth) is given in [[polynomial least squares]]. 

16. 

One of the fundamental statistical methods used by econometricians is [[regression analysis]].<ref>For an overview of a linear implementation of this framework, see [[linear regression]].</ref> Regression methods are important in econometrics because economists typically cannot use [[Contrived experiment|controlled experiments]].

==Journals==
The main journals that publish work in econometrics are ''[[Econometrica]]'', the ''[[Journal of Econometrics]]'', the ''[[Review of Economics and Statistics]]'', ''[[Econometric Theory]]'', the ''[[Journal of Applied Econometrics]]'', ''[[Econometric Reviews]]'', the ''[[Econometrics Journal]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=1368-4221 |title=The Econometrics Journal – Wiley Online Library |publisher=Wiley.com |accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref> ''[[Applied Econometrics and International Development]]'', and the ''[[Journal of Business & Economic Statistics]]''.

==Basic models: linear regression==
A basic tool for econometrics is the [[multiple linear regression]] model.<ref name="Greene Econometrics – multiple linear regression model" /> In modern econometrics, other statistical tools are frequently used, but linear regression is still the most frequently used starting point for an analysis.<ref name="Greene Econometrics – multiple linear regression model">{{cite book|author=Greene, William|title=Econometric Analysis|date=2012|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=9780273753568|pages=47–48|edition=7th|chapter=Chapter 1: Econometrics | quote = Ultimately, all of these will require a common set of tools, including, for example, the multiple regression model, the use of moment conditions for estimation, instrumental variables (IV) and maximum likelihood estimation.
