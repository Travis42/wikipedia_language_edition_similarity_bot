Herbert Butterfield

en edition's differences with the ja version: 


1. 

Butterfield found the Whig interpretation of history objectionable, because it warps the past to see it in terms of the issues of the present and attempts to squeeze the contending forces of the past into a form that reminds us of ourselves. 

2. 
in every Englishman there is hidden something of a whig that seems to tug at the heart-strings.<ref>Herbert Butterfield, ''The Englishman and His History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1944), pp. 

3. 
Butterfield was a devout Christian and reflected at length on Christian influences in historical perspectives. 

4.

6. 
Vickers considers the book a late example of the earliest stage of modern analysis of the history of [[Renaissance]] magic in relation to the development of science, when magic was largely dismissed as being "entertaining but irrelevant".<ref name="VickersVickers1984">{{cite book|last1=Vickers|first1=Brian|title=Occult and scientific mentalities in the Renaissance|last2=Vickers|first2=Brian|chapter=Introduction|year=1984|pages=1–56|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511572999.002|isbn=9780511572999}}</ref>

==Prizes and accolades==

7. 
At the height of the [[Cold War]], he warned that conflicts between self-righteous value systems could be catastrophic:
:The greatest menace to our civilization is the conflict between giant organized systems of self-righteousness - each only too delighted to find that the other is wicked - each only too glad that the sins of the other give it pretext for still deeper hatred.<ref>''Christianity, Diplomacy and War'' (1952)</ref>

=== ''The Whig Interpretation of History'' ===

Butterfield's book, ''The Whig Interpretation of History'' (1931), became a classic for history students and is still widely read.<ref>William Cronon, "Two Cheers for the Whig Interpretation of History" (American Historical Association, September 2012) online at https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/september-2012/two-cheers-for-the-whig-interpretation-of-history.</ref> Butterfield had in mind especially the historians of his own country but his criticism of the retrospective creation of a line of progress toward the glorious present can be and has subsequently been applied generally. 

8. 
We can do worse than remember a principle which both gives us a firm Rock and leaves us the maximum elasticity for our minds: the principle: Hold to Christ, and for the rest be totally uncommitted."

===''The Origins of Modern Science''===
According to [[Brian Vickers (literary scholar)|Brian Vickers]] {{post-nominals|FBA}}, in the 1949 book ''The Origins of Modern Science'' Butterfield makes simplistic generalisations which "seem unworthy of a serious historian".

10. 
We, on the other hand, will not dream of wishing it away, but will rejoice in an interpretation of the past which has grown up with us, has grown up with the history itself, and has helped to make the history...
