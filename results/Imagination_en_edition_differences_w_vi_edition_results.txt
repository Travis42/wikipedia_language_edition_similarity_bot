==The mind's eye==
The notion of a "mind's eye" goes back at least to [[Cicero]]'s reference to '''''mentis oculi''''' during his discussion of the orator's appropriate use of [[simile]].<ref>[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=XCU9AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA535#v=onepage Cicero, ''De Oratore'', Liber III: XLI: 163.]</ref>

In this discussion, Cicero observed that allusions to "the [[Gulf of Gabès|Syrtis]] of his patrimony" and "the [[Charybdis]] of his possessions" involved similes that were "too far-fetched"; and he advised the orator to, instead, just speak of "the rock" and "the gulf" (respectively) — on the grounds that "the eyes of the mind are more easily directed to those objects which we have seen, than to those which we have only heard".<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ciceroonoratorya00ciceuoft#page/239/mode/1upWatson, J.S

==Versus belief==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}
Imagination is different from [[belief]] because the subject understands that what is personally invented by the mind does not necessarily affect the course of action taken in the apparently shared world, while beliefs are part of what one holds as truths about both the shared and personal worlds

This difference is only one of degree and can be altered by several historic causes, namely changes to brain chemistry, [[hypnosis]] or other [[Altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]], [[meditation]], many hallucinogenic drugs, and electricity applied directly to specific parts of the brain

The concept of "the mind's eye" first appeared in English in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] (c.1387) [[The Man of Law's Prologue and Tale|Man of Law's Tale]] in his [[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]], where he tells us that one of the three men dwelling in a castle was blind, and could only see with "the eyes of his mind"; namely, those eyes "with which all men see after they have become blind".<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/canterburyprol00chauuoft#page/78/mode/1up ''The Man of Laws Tale'', lines 550-553.]</ref>

The condition of not being able to internally visualize (the lack of a ”mind’s eye”) is called [[Aphantasia]]

Some cultures and traditions even view the apparently shared world as an illusion of the mind as with the [[Buddhist]] Maya, or go to the opposite extreme and accept the imagined and dreamed realms as of equal validity to the apparently shared world as the [[Australian Aborigines]] do with their concept of [[dreamtime]]

When children develop fantasy they play at two levels: first, they use [[role playing]] to act out what they have developed with their imagination, and at the second level they play again with their make-believe situation by acting as if what they have developed is an actual reality.<ref>{{cite book |author=Laurence Goldman |title=Child's play: myth, mimesis and make-believe
