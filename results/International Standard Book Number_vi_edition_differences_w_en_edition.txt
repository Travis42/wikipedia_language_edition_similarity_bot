How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

International Standard Book Number

vi edition's differences with the en version: 


1. 
This means that it will allow booksellers to use a single-digit system for both books and non-book products without damaging the compatibility with the old ISBN-based information, with a minimal cost to their information technology systems. 

2. 
A detailed description of the EAN-13 format has [http://www.barcodeisland.com/ean13.phtml here] or view [[EAN-13]].

At present, the barcodes found on the back cover of the book (or Inside on the first cover of other publications) are [[EAN-13]]; They can also be "Bookland" — that is, with a separate barcode, it is coded 5 numbers for the type of currency and the recommended retail price. 

4. 
It can have 10 numbers of self (older) or 13 numbers (the new type, which applies with [[barcode]]), including four or five sections. 

5. 
This shift also makes the ISBN system suitable for the barcode system [UPC]. 

6. 
This is currently happening rapidly outside the country [[United States | United States]. 

7. 

The different sections are of different lengths and are usually interconnected by strikethrough. 

8. 
However, they are insufficient because different authorities are responsible for providing and performing different ISBN numbers. 

9. 

The country code (or language code) 0 and 1 is used in English languages; 2 for French-language countries; 3 for German, etc. 

10. 
Note that the code that identifies the publisher is uncertain would be the same as the code in the ISBN 978 and 979. 

11. 

Hence the test number is 2, and the complete banana number is <nowiki> ISBN 0-306-40615-2 </nowiki>. 

12. 

The publisher's number is set according to the country's ISBN authority and the number of order chosen by the book publisher. 

13. 

The second method to find the test number is done as follows, taking each number in the first 9 digits with its position number (from 1 to 9). 

14. 
This means that each of the first nine numbers of the ISBN series with 10 digits – except the test number – is multiply by the numbers in order from 10 to 2 and obtain the sum of these, plus the test number, which must be split by 11.

The ISBN system was created in the UK for years [[1966]] by book distributors and [[Stationery]] [[W H Smith]] with friends, originally referred to as ' Standard Book Numbering ' ' (Standard code for books) or SBN. 

17. 

For example, calculating the test number for the number sequence ISBN 10 number that the first 9 digits is 0-306-40615 is executed as follows:

10 × 0 + 9 × 3 + 8 × 0 + 7 × 6 + 6 × 4 + 5 × 0 + 4 × 6 + 3 × 1 + 2 × 5
 = 0 + 27 + 0 + 42 + 24 + 0 + 24 + 3 + 10
 = 130

The smallest number to add to can be split by 11 is 2, due to 132/11 = 12 and no residual. 

18. 
A similar format, ' ' International Standard Serial Number ' ' (International Standard Code for magazines) or ISSN, is used for periodic publications such as [[Magazine]]. 

19. 
For example, to find the test number for the 10 ISBN number the first 9 digits are 0-306-40615:

1 × 0 + 2 × 3 + 3 × 0 + 4 × 6 + 5 × 4 + 6 × 0 + 7 × 6 + 8 × 1 + 9 × 5
 = 0 + 6 + 0 + 24 + 20 + 0 + 42 + 8 + 45
 = 145
 = 13 × 11 + 2

Thus the number of checks equals 2, and the complete number sequence is <nowiki> ISBN 0-306-40615-2 </nowiki>.
