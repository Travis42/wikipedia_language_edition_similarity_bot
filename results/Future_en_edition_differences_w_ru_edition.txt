This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

[[Agnosticism|Agnostics]] generally hold the position that like the existence of God, the existence of supernatural phenomena, such as souls or life after death, is unverifiable and therefore unknowable.<ref>{{cite dictionary | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/agnostic | title=agnositic | dictionary=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=2 August 2014}}</ref> Many religions, whether they believe in the soul's existence in another world like Christianity, Islam and many [[Paganism|pagan]] belief systems, or in reincarnation like many forms of Hinduism and Buddhism, believe that one's status in the afterlife is a reward or punishment for their conduct during life, with the exception of [[Calvinistic]] variants of [[Protestant]] Christianity, which believes one's status in the afterlife is a gift from God and cannot be earned during life.
