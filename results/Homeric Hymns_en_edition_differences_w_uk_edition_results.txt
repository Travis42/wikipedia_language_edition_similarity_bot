This still places the older ''Homeric Hymns'' among the oldest monuments of [[Greek literature]]; but although most of them were composed in the seventh and sixth centuries, a few may be [[Hellenistic]], and the ''Hymn to Ares'' might be a late pagan work, inserted when it was observed that a hymn to [[Ares]] was lacking

[[Walter Burkert]] has suggested that the ''Hymn to Apollo'', attributed by an ancient source to [[Cynaethus]] of Chios (a member of the [[Homeridae]]), was composed in 522 BC for performance at the unusual double festival held by [[Polycrates of Samos]] to honor Apollo of [[Delos]] and of [[Delphi]].<ref>[[Walter Burkert]]
