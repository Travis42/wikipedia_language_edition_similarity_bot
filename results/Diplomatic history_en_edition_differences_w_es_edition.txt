In the early 1980s, historian Jeffrey Kimball surveyed the ideological preferences of 109 active diplomatic historians in the United States as well as 54 active military historians.

For Overy, a major problem with the Mason thesis was that it rested on the assumption that in a way unrecorded by the records, that information was passed on to Hitler about the ''Reich'''s economic problems.<ref name="Mason, Tim page 102">Mason, Tim & Overy, R.J.

===Mason-Overy debate on internal pressures inside Nazi Germany===
A notable example of the ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' approach was the claim by the British [[Marxist historian]] [[Timothy Mason]] who claimed that the launch of World War II in 1939 was best understood as a “barbaric variant of social imperialism”.<ref>Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000  page 7</ref> Mason argued that “Nazi Germany was always bent ''at some time'' upon a major war of expansion”.<ref name="Kaillis, Aristotle page 165">Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000  page 165</ref> However, Mason argued that the timing of such a war was determined by domestic political pressures, especially as relating to a failing economy, and had nothing to do with what Hitler wanted.<ref name="Kaillis, Aristotle page 165"/> In Mason's view in the period between 1936–41, it was the state of the German economy, and not Hitler's "will" or "intentions" that was the most important determinate on German decision-making on foreign policy.<ref name="Kershaw, Ian' page 88">Kershaw, Ian'' The Nazi Dictatorship'' London : Arnold 2000 page 88.</ref> Mason argued that the Nazi leaders were deeply haunted by the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|November Revolution]] of 1918, and was most unwilling to see any fall in working class living standards out of the fear that it might provoke another November Revolution.<ref name="Kershaw, Ian' page 88"/> According to Mason, by 1939, the “overheating” of the German economy caused by rearmament, the failure of various rearmament plans produced by the shortages of skilled workers, industrial unrest caused by the breakdown of German social policies, and the sharp drop in living standards for the German working class forced Hitler into going to war at a time and place not of his choosing.<ref>Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000  pages 165-166</ref> Mason contended that when faced with the deep socio-economic crisis the Nazi leadership had decided to embark upon a ruthless “smash and grab” foreign policy of seizing territory in Eastern Europe which could be pitilessly plundered to support living standards in Germany.<ref>Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000  page 166</ref> Mason's theory of a "Flight into war" being imposed on Hitler generated much controversy, and in the 1980s he conducted a series of debates with economic historian [[Richard Overy]] over this matter.

Starting in the 1960s, a ferocious debate has taken place within Cold War historiography between the advocates of the “orthodox” school which saw the Cold War as a case of Soviet aggression such as [[Vojtech Mastny]] against the proponents of the “revisionist” school which saw the Cold War as a case of American aggression. 

10. 
The [[Vietnam War]] led to the rise of a revisionist school in the United States, which led many American historians such as [[Gabriel Kolko]] and [[William Appleman Williams]] to reject traditional diplomatic history in favor of a ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' approach that saw a widespread examination of the influence of American domestic politics together with various social, economic and cultural forces on foreign-policy making.

===Fischer debate on World War One===
At the same time, in 1961 when the German historian [[Fritz Fischer]] published ''Griff nach der Weltmacht'', which established that Germany had caused the First World War led to the fierce "Fischer Controversy" that tore apart the West German historical profession.<ref name="ReferenceA">Matusumoto, Saho "Diplomatic History" pages 314-316 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'' page 315.</ref> One result of Fischer's book was the rise in the ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' (Primacy of Domestic Politics) approach.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> As a result of the rise of the ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' school, diplomatic historians increasing started to pay attention to domestic politics.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In the 1970s, the conservative German historian [[Andreas Hillgruber]], together with his close associate [[Klaus Hildebrand]], was involved in a very acrimonious debate with the leftish German historian [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] over the merits of the ''Primat der Aussenpolitik'' ("primacy of foreign politics") and ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' ("primacy of domestic politics") schools.<ref>[[Kershaw, Ian]] ''The Nazi Dictatorship'', London, Arnold, 2000, pp. 

14. 
 This emphasis, combined with the effects of the [[War Guilt Clause]] in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919) which ended the [[First World War]], led to a huge amount of historical writing on the subject of the [[origins of the war of 1914]], with the involved governments printing huge, carefully edited, collections of documents and numerous historians writing multi-volume histories of the origins of the war.<ref>Covered in depth in [[William L.

In general, the American Cold War revisionists tended to focus on American foreign policy decision-making with respect to the genesis of the Cold War in the 1940s and on how the United States became involved in Vietnam in the 1960s.

 This in turn led diplomatic historians to start to abandon the previous Euro-centric approach in favor of a more global approach.<ref>Saho Matusumoto, "Diplomatic History" in Kelly Boyd, ed., ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'' (1999) pp 314-165</ref>  A sign of the changing times was the rise to prominence of such diplomatic historians such as the Japanese historian Chihiro Hosoya, the British historian [[Ian Nish]], and the American historian [[Akira Iriye]], which was the first time that Asian specialists became noted diplomatic historians.

Historian Muriel Chamberlain notes that after the First World War:
: diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies.<ref>Muriel E Chamberlain, ''Pax Britannica'.

===Japanese-American relations===
In addition, because World War II was a global war, diplomatic historians start to focus on [[Japanese-American relations]] to understand why Japan had attacked the United States in 1941. 

35. 
 Ranke saw diplomatic history as the most important kind of history to write because of his idea of the "Primacy of Foreign Affairs" (''Primat der Aussenpolitik''), arguing that the concerns of international relations drive the internal development of the state.

A group of French historians centered around [[Pierre Renouvin]] (1893-1974) and his ''protégés'' [[Jean-Baptiste Duroselle]] and Maurice Baumont started a new type of international history in the 1950s that included taking into account what Renouvin called ''{{lang|fr|forces profondes}}'' (profound forces) such as the influence of domestic politics on French foreign policy.
