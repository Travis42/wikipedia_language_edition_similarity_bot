The writing of the ''Shoku Nihongi'', the first successor to the ''Nihon Shoki'' began about 760 by [[Fujiwara no Nakamaro]], but suffered several setbacksseveral before its publication in 797, such as Nakamaro's death in the [[Fujiwara no Nakamaro Rebellion]] in 764; the thirty draft volumes drew criticism for concentrating on anecdotal facts and ignoring some major events.{{sfn|Bentley|2015|p=64}}  [[Emperor Kōnin]] had the project revived, but it still remained in draft form

The line of argument is that modernization was not a single simple trajectory toward social economic and political progress, but it also could have authoritarian and statist outcomes, and in some cases it was led by the militarists.<ref>Sheldon  Garon, “Rethinking modernization and modernity in Japanese history: A focus on state-society relations,” ‘’Journal of Asian Studies’’ (1994) 53#2 pp 346-366.</ref>.<ref>Sébastien Conrad,  "‘The Colonial Ties Are Liquidated’: Modernization Theory, Post-War Japan and the Global Cold War."

 The emergence of this type of publication became possible through the strengthening of centralized authority within a strong state.{{sfn|Mehl|1998|p=6}}

The authors of the ''Kojiki'' of 712 trace the first work of this type to 620, when [[Prince Shōtoku]] is said to have written the first historical books, the ''[[Tennōki]]'' and ''[[Kokki]]''
0.121349
 In contrast to earlier chronicles, these texts take a more subjective approach, concentrating on narrative to attract the interest of the reader,{{sfn|Mehl|1998|pp=6–7}} and were written in Japanese rather than classical Chinese.{{sfn|Bentley|2015|p=70}}  They focus more on historical figures, in particular in ''[[gunki monogatari]]'' "warrior tales".{{sfn|Mehl|1998|p=7}}

The earliest of these accounts, the ''[[Eiga Monogatari]]'', follows the ''Rikkokushi'', as it begins in 887 and completes the ''Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku''.{{sfn|Bentley|2015|p=70}}  It contains numerous dating errors (about 20% of the dates are incorrect), and many embellishments and fabrications

 A great number of historical tales called ''[[rekishi monogatari]]'' and war tales called ''[[gunki monogatari]]'' appeared, and works such as the ''[[shikyō]]'' "four mirrors" of the 12th to 14th centuries and ''[[The Tale of the Heike]]'' of 1371 enjoyed widespread popularity

 The form is unknown, but they are likely to have copied Chinese chronicles with Korean influences due to their transmission through the kingdom of [[Baekje]] on the [[Korean Peninsula]].{{sfn|Bentley|2015|p=59}}

The ''Kojiki'' was intended essentially for use within the court and is written in a mixture of [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Man'yōgana|phonetic readings of Chinese characters]].{{sfn|Bentley|2015|p=61}}  It takes [[Imperial China]] as its model{{sfn|Bentley|2015|p=61}} and depicts the territory of Japan as extending historically to territorial claims as far back as the Korean kingdom of Baekje

==Beginnings through the Middle Ages==

===Earliest chronicles to the ''Nihon Shoki''===

[[File:Nihon Shoki Maeda.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour photo of a handwritten Japanese text on aged paper|The ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' of 720, one of the earliest texts tracing the [[history of Japan]] ]]

The earliest extant works aiming to present the [[History of Japan]] appeared in the 8th century CE
0.249922
 The latter asserts Japan as a country chosen by the gods and thus superior to all others, which has left a lasting influence on Japanese historiography, politics, and nationalism.{{sfn|Mehl|1998|p=7}}

===Diversification of forms at the end of the Middle Ages===

During the Japanese Middle Ages the ''gunki monogatari'' remained an important genre of historical narrative.{{sfn|Sato|2015|p=80}}  The country underwent numerous periods of civil conflict, such as the [[Nanboku-chō period|Nanboku-chō]] (1336–1392), [[Sengoku period|Sengoku]] (1467–1603), and [[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] (1573–1603), driving the popularity of such works.{{sfn|Sato|2015|p=81}}  The 15th-century {{illm|Ōninki|ja|応仁記|lt=''Ōninki''}} covers the [[Ōnin War]] (1467–1477) and is one of the major representatives of the style of the period.{{sfn|Sato|2015|p=81}}  Two other prominent examples appeared at the beginning of the 17th century, both biographical accounts of military leaders: that of [[Oda Nobunaga]] in the ''[[Shinchō kōki]]'' and that of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] in the ''[[Taikōki]]''.{{sfn|Sato|2015|p=82}}

Diplomatic history first appeared in Japan in 1470 with the publication of {{illm|Zuikei Shūhō|ja|瑞渓周鳳}}'s {{illm|Zenrin Kokuhōki|ja|善隣国宝記|lt=''Zenrin Kokuhōki''}}{{sfn|Sato|2015|p=82}} which traces the nature of international exchanges between Japan, China, and Korea
