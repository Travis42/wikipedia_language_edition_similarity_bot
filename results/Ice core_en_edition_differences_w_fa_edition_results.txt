 There is increasingly dense [[firn]] between surface snow and blue glacier ice.|alt=A scientist in a pit of snow]]

An ice core is a vertical column through a glacier, sampling the layers that formed through an annual cycle of snowfall and melt.<ref name=":23" /> As snow accumulates, each layer presses on lower layers, making them denser until they turn into [[firn]]

Ice cores have been studied since the early 20th century, and several cores were drilled as a result of the [[International Geophysical Year]] (1957–1958)
-6.12999e-10
 To address this, work has been done on technology to drill replicate cores: additional cores, retrieved by drilling into the sidewall of the borehole, at depths of particular interest

 Hand augers can be rotated by a [[T-handle|T handle]] or a [[Brace (tool)|brace handle]], and some can be attached to handheld [[electric drill]]s to power the rotation
-4.37922e-10
 Drilling began in 1996; the first hole had to be abandoned at 1400&nbsp;m in 1997, and a new hole was begun in 1999, reaching 3085&nbsp;m in 2003
-3.73291e-10
 The cuttings are removed from the fluid at the top of the hole and the fluid is then pumped back down.<ref name=":3" />  This approach requires long trip times, since the entire drill string must be hoisted out of the hole, and each length of pipe must be separately disconnected, and then reconnected when the drill string is reinserted.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4">{{harvnb|Talalay|2016}}, p

-1.0732e-10
 The simplest approach is to count layers of ice that correspond to the original annual layers of snow, but this is not always possible
-1.0732e-10
50–51.</ref>

Any method of counting layers eventually runs into difficulties as the flow of the ice causes the layers to become thinner and harder to see with increasing depth.<ref>{{harvnb|Alley|2000}}, p
-8.56062e-11
Buried under the snow of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow

 A six-foot pit may show anything from less than a year of snow to several years of snow, depending on the location
-8.56062e-11

 The cores were dated by potassium-argon dating; traditional ice core dating is not possible as not all layers were present
-3.11005e-11
 In some cases there are contributions from more than one source to a given species: for example, Ca<sup>++</sup> comes from dust as well as from marine sources; the marine input is much greater than the dust input and so although the two sources peak at different times of the year, the overall signal shows a peak in the winter, when the marine input is at a maximum.<ref>{{harvnb|Legrand|Mayewski|1997}}, p

 To install casing a shallow auger can be used to create a pilot hole, which is then [[Reaming|reamed]] (expanded) until it is wide enough to accept the casing; a large diameter auger can also be used, avoiding the need for reaming

 The standard method of recording the {{chem|18|O}}/{{chem|16|O}} ratio is to subtract the ratio in a standard known as [[Standard Mean Ocean Water|standard mean ocean water]] (SMOW):<ref name=":5" />

<math>\mathrm{\delta ^{18}O} = \Biggl( \mathrm{\frac{\bigl( \frac{^{18}O}{^{16}O} \bigr)_{sample}}{\bigl( \frac{^{18}O}{^{16}O} \bigr)_{SMOW}}} -1 \Biggr) \times 1000\ ^{o}\!/\!_{oo},</math>

where the ‰ sign indicates [[parts per thousand]].<ref name=":5" />  A sample with the same {{chem|18|O}}/{{chem|16|O}} ratio as SMOW has a {{delta|18|O}} of 0‰; a sample that is depleted in {{chem|18|O}} has a negative {{delta|18|O}}.<ref name=":5" />  Combining the {{delta|18|O}} measurements of an ice core sample with the borehole temperature at the depth it came from provides additional information, in some cases leading to significant corrections to the temperatures deduced from the {{delta|18|O}} data.<ref>{{harvnb|Alley|2000}}, pp

 Two holes, 30&nbsp;km apart, were eventually drilled at the north-central location in the early 1990s by two groups: [[Greenland Ice Core Project|GRIP]], a European consortium, and GISP-2, a group of US universities
9.2939e-11
165–170.</ref>  Because {{chem|16|O}} is lighter than {{chem|18|O}}, water containing {{chem|16|O}} is slightly more likely to turn into vapour, and water containing {{chem|18|O}} is slightly more likely to condense from vapour into rain or snow crystals

2.49202e-10
56.</ref>  The problem is more acute at locations where accumulation is high; low accumulation sites, such as central Antarctica, must be dated by other methods.<ref name=":13" />  For example, at Vostok, layer counting is only possible down to an age of 55,000 years.<ref name=Ruddiman>{{Cite journal|last=Ruddiman|first=William F.|year=2003|title=Core handling and processing for the WAIS Divide ice-core project|url=http://moraymo.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2003_ruddimanraymo.pdf|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=22|issue=68|pages=141–142|via=|last2=Raymo|first2=Maureen E.|doi=10.3189/2014AoG68A008}}</ref>

When there is summer melting, the melted snow refreezes lower in the snow and firn, and the resulting layer of ice has very few bubbles so is easy to recognise in a visual examination of a core
3.0559e-10
 These data can be combined to find the [[climate model]] that best fits all the available data
3.0559e-10
 This means that the trapped air retains, in the ratio of {{chem|O|2}} to {{chem|N|2}}, a record of the summer insolation, and hence combining this data with orbital cycle data establishes an ice core dating scheme.<ref name=":13" /><ref>{{harvnb|Landais|Dreyfus|Capron|Pol|2012}}, p

 If the date of the eruption is not known, but it can be identified in multiple cores, then dating the ice can in turn give a date for the eruption, which can then be used as a reference layer.<ref name=":22" />  This was done, for example, in an analysis of the climate for the period from 535 to 550 AD, which was thought to be influenced by an otherwise unknown tropical eruption in about 533 AD; but which turned out to be caused by two eruptions, one in 535 or early 536 AD, and a second one in 539 or 540 AD.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sigl|first1=M.|last2=Winstrup|first2=M.|last3=McConnell|first3=J

101.</ref>  Along with the logistical difficulties associated with bringing heavy equipment to ice sheets, this makes traditional rotary drills unattractive.<ref name=":2" />  In contrast, [[Wireline (cabling)|wireline]] drills allow the removal of the core barrel from the drill assembly while it is still at the bottom of the borehole
6.0345e-10
 Early thermal drills, designed for use without drilling fluid, were limited in depth as a result; later versions were modified to work in fluid-filled holes but this slowed down trip times, and these drills retained the problems of the earlier models
6.2937e-10
 Ice from Greenland cores contains dust carried by wind; the dust appears most strongly in late winter, and appears as cloudy grey layers
6.91898e-10
 Below this depth, electromechanical or thermal drills are used.<ref name=":1" />

The cutting apparatus of a drill is on the bottom end of a drill barrel, the tube that surrounds the core as the drill cuts downward

Because {{chem|C|H|4}} (methane) is produced in lakes and [[wetland]]s, the amount in the atmosphere is correlated with the strength of [[monsoon]]s, which are in turn correlated with the strength of [[tropics|low-latitude]] summer [[Solar irradiance|insolation]]

===  Physical properties ===
In addition to the impurities in a core and the isotopic composition of the water, the physical properties of the ice are examined
9.02219e-10
 Since [[Heat transfer|heat flow]] in a large ice sheet is very slow, the borehole temperature is another indicator of temperature in the past
1.02091e-09
 The size of a crystal is related to its growth rate, which in turn depends on the temperature, so the properties of the bubbles can be combined with information on accumulation rates and firn density to calculate the temperature when the firn formed.<ref name=":21">{{harvnb|Alley|2010}}, p

=== Non-polar cores ===
Ice cores have been drilled at locations away from the poles, notably in the [[Himalayas]] and the [[Andes]]

A spring-loaded lever arm called a core dog can break off the core and hold it in place while it is brought to the surface

 The surface that receives the core should be aligned as accurately as possible with the drill barrel to minimise mechanical stress on the core, which can easily break

109–111.</ref>  The drilling fluid is usually circulated down around the outside of the drill and back up between the core and core barrel; the cuttings are stored in the downhole assembly, in a chamber above the core
0.196537
 The core is then extracted from the drill barrel, usually by laying it out flat so that the core can slide out onto a prepared surface.<ref name=":7" />  The core must be cleaned of drilling fluid as it is slid out; for the [[WAIS Divide]] coring project, a vacuuming system was set up to facilitate this

 EM drills are also more likely to fracture ice cores where the ice is under high stress.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwikowski|first1=Margit|last2=Jenk|first2=Theo M.|last3=Stampfli|first3=Dieter|last4=Stampfli|first4=Felix|title=A new thermal drilling system for high-altitude or temperate glaciers|journal=Annals of Glaciology|date=26 July 2017|volume=55|issue=68|pages=131–136|doi=10.3189/2014AoG68A024}}</ref>

When drilling deep holes, which require drilling fluid, the hole must be [[Casing (borehole)|cased]] (fitted with a cylindrical lining), since otherwise the drilling fluid will be absorbed by the snow and firn

It was understood in the 1960s that analyzing the air trapped in ice cores would provide useful information on the [[paleoatmosphere]], but it was not until the late 1970s that a reliable extraction method was developed

 Another method is to correlate radionuclides or trace atmospheric gases with other timescales such as periodicities in the earth's [[orbital parameter]]s.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://ww2.valdosta.edu/~dmthieme/Geomorph/Walker_2005_QuaternaryDatingMethods.pdf|title=Quaternary Dating Methods|last=Walker|first=Mike|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2005|isbn=978-0-470-86927-7|location=Chichester|page=150|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714195126/http://ww2.valdosta.edu/~dmthieme/Geomorph/Walker_2005_QuaternaryDatingMethods.pdf|archive-date=14 July 2014|df=}}</ref>

A difficulty in ice core dating is that gases can [[Diffusion|diffuse]] through firn, so the ice at a given depth may be substantially older than the gases trapped in it
0.262049
 An alternative to casing is to use water in the borehole to saturate the porous snow and firn; the water eventually turns to ice.<ref name=":6" />

Ice cores from different depths are not all equally in demand by scientific investigators, which can lead to a shortage of ice cores at certain depths
0.262049
The drawbacks are that it is difficult to accurately control the dimensions of the borehole, the core cannot easily be kept sterile, and the heat may cause [[thermal shock]] to the core.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Exploration of Antarctic Subglacial Aquatic Environments: Environmental and Scientific Stewardship|last=National Research Council of the National Academies|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-309-10635-1|location=Washington DC|pages=82–84}}</ref>

When drilling in temperate ice, thermal drills have an advantage over electromechanical (EM) drills: ice melted by pressure can refreeze on EM drill bits, reducing cutting efficiency, and can clog other parts of the mechanism
