The idea goes from the most material, painting, to at least material, passing through music, which has as matter the sound, and comes to poetry, which is the universal art of the spirit since it has as material the beautiful fantasy

Cause and effect are moments of universal reciprocal dependence, of the connection and reciprocal concatenation of events, links in the chain of the development of matter and society: the same thing is presented first as cause and then as an effect

It is a moment of happiness given by the harmony between the whole (the city) and the parties (the citizens), where individuals understand their destiny as a direct expression of collective destiny and where, as Hegel puts it in a way inspired by the '[Antigona (Sophocles)' Antigone]]'' of [Sophocles], human law and divine law coincide

Like other exponents of historicalism, Hegel considered the study of [[history]to be the appropriate method for addressing the study of the science of [society], as it would reveal some trends in historical development

The principle of the excluded third party, something is either A or not A, is the proposition that wants to reject the contradiction and in doing so is precisely contradicted: A must be +A or -A, with which the third term is already introduced, A, which is neither nor nor - and for the same reason and therefore e +A and -A

Once it ceases to meet these needs, the work of art generates in us, in addition to immediate joy, thought and reflection; generates judgment in us, and it will aim to know the art, the spirit that appears in it, its ''being there''
0.00689456
But the victory of the intellect - which is the denial of the whole or unity - is only temporary and prepares the definitive victory of the whole, in the form of the all-encompassing system of hegel's own reason, which is but the denial of denial and thus a return to the original affirmation, but now enriched by intermediate development

The court of reason became the revolutionary court, where it was not only decapitated in the past but also the revolutionaries themselves
0.0085281
What the failure of the attempt to establish the realm of absolute freedom showed was that men, in reality, have nothing to change in the essentials, that they cannot build a world as they please, that the past is not a pure string of stupid irrationalities , that what has existed has a lasting meaning and content, which is nothing less than the expressions of reason at its various times, all of which are necessary to achieve its proper form

Hegel distinguishes three artistic forms: the ''Symbolic artistic form'', the ''Classic artistic form'' and the ''Romantic artistic form''

The end of the story was, for Hegel, the parahazard of the spirit, and historical development could be equated to the development of an organism, the components work affecting the rest and have defined functions
0.0113708

Within the field of aesthetics or philosophy of art, Hegel distinguishes between ''free art'' and ''s servile art'', having this last purpose outside of it, such as decorating
0.0113708
Greek art, sculpture, is the art of the classical art form
0.0113708
Art, in its essence, belongs to the past always, because it is in it that it fulfills it, it is in Greek art that Art achieves its ultimate goal, the total representation of the idea
0.0113708
The real task of art is to bring to consciousness the true interests of the spirit and that is why, when thought of by science, art fulfills its purpose
0.0113708

Many philosophers will return to the subject of art in Hegel, [Hans-Georg Gadamer], for example, will speak of "The Death of Art" referring to Hegelian aesthetics
0.0117207
Hegel never spoke of a death of art but gave it the character of the past, past not understood as something that no longer exists; the "past character of art" is intimately linked with the end of Hegelian philosophy, to know the spirit, to make it free

It is free art that will be studied, since it has its own purposes, it is free and true, because it is a way of expressing the divine in a sensitive way

The logic of the concept is ordinarily understood as only formal science, but if the logical forms of the concept were dead, passive vessels, mere representations and thoughts, its knowledge would be superfluous; but in reality they are like forms of concept, the living spirit of the real and therefore it is necessary to investigate the truth of these forms and their necessary connection

Identity is the determination of the simple immediate and static, while contradiction is the root of every movement and vitality, the principle of all self-movement and only that which encloses a contradiction moves

0.0227416
Unlike [[Kant], his predecessor, Hegel advocated a type of [[Reason]] that resulted from the dialectical relationship between individual reasoning and the unpredictable facts of reality, and whose substance could only be apprehended afterwards, thus being a historical, collective and providenistic reason
0.0241211
Hence its expression "cunning of Reason", because it could hardly be seen by anyone to consider all the relevant variables to realize in the world, predictably an idea of consciousness: reason produces results that "escape" the forecasts one could make in relation to its present functionality, deploying according to a predestination that a priori is inaccessible to it
0.0255843
Hegel introduced a system to understand the [history of philosophy]] and the world itself, often called "[dialectic]]": a progression in which each successive movement arises as a solution to the contradictions inherent in the previous movement
0.0262271
But Hegel not only does not believe this possible, since both reason and sensitivity would not lend themselves to such mediation and would claim its purity, but it also clarifies that, being a mediator, art would not gain more seriousness, since this would not be an end in itself and art would follow e subordinate for more serious, superior purposes
0.0262597
His theory was reinterpreted by [[Karl Marx]] from a materialistic perspective, thus subordinating the human race and its reason (secondary phenomenon in Marx) to the swings of the great conformations of matter (the Church, the State and the Market, for example): the human being irremissibly depends on his ideal and material conditions, confronting them in an enduring dialectic, which does not free him in any way, but rather gives him a new material form in each dialectical cycle
0.027901

Hegel's philosophy stated that everything that is real is also rational and that everything that is rational is real
0.0281413
For Hegel it meant the definitive abandonment of every utopian dream – including those youthful dreams of a restoration of that supposed state of primal harmony represented by the polis of antiquity – to become the deeply conservative of his mature age, that thinker who is no longer the philosopher of revolution but of restoration
0.0301514

The ordinary imagination captures identity, difference and contradiction, but not the ''transition'' from one to the other, which is the most important thing, how one becomes the other becomes the other

He admired the works of [[Platon], [[Aristotle],[[Descartes]], [[Baruch de Spinoza] Spinoza]], [[Immanuel Kant' Kant]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau] Rousseau], as well as the [French Revolution], which he ended up rejecting when it fell into the hands of The Jacobin terror
0.0369551
The French Revolution represents for Hegel the attempt to establish on earth the realm of what he calls "absolute freedom" ('die absolute Freiheit'')

All three closely followed the development of the [French Revolution] and were influenced by [Immanuel Kant] Kant]], the greatest philosopher in Germany, as well as [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte' Fichte]
0.0426405
Existence is the immediate unity of being and reflection: Possibility and accidentality are moments of reality put as forms that constitute the externality of the real and are therefore a matter that affects the content, because in reality this exteriority, with interiority, in a unique movement and becomes ''need''', so that what is necessary is mediated by a cluster of circumstances or conditions
0.0426405
Instead, appearance in the artistic is presented as illusion, takes away from the object the pretence of truth that it has in reality and gives it a higher reality, daughter of the spirit
0.0441252
The beauty in art is beauty generated by the spirit, therefore partaker of it, unlike the natural beauty that will not be worthy of an aesthetic research, precisely because it is not partaker of that spirit that is the ultimate end of knowledge
0.0582927

The conflict between the whole and the parties reaches its sharpest form in the struggle that directly precedes the hegel era: the struggle between illustration and superstition ('der kampf der Aufkl-rung mit dem Aberglauben'')

The Greek sculptures were not, for the Greeks, representations of the god but were the god himself

By having art as its essence the spirit, it follows that its nature is to think, so that the products of beautiful art, beyond the freedom and arbitrage that they may have, as partakers of the spirit, it sets limits, points of support

He received his training in the '[T'binger Stift]'' (seminar of the [[Church (organization)' Church]] [[Protestantism] Protestante]] in Wurtemberg), where he befriended the future philosopher [[Friedrich Schelling]] and the poet [[Friedrich H'lderlin]
0.0792874
A new principle had been embodied and would become the axis of a new state, the "rational state", which did not deny the previous distinctions of civil society or the individual but subordinated them all to a new organic unit, into a higher harmony that was thus the denial of denial, the end of alienation, the reconciliation of the parties with the whole and of individuals with the community
0.0824383

Considered by the classical history of philosophy as the representative of "the summit of the German [[nineteenth century] German movement of philosophical [[idealism]" and as a revolutionary of [dialéctic], it should have a profound impact on [[historical materialism]] [[Karl Marx]]

Alongside the ''Phenomenology of the Spirit'' are Hegel's most important works the '[Science of Logic]]'' ('Wissenschaft der Logik'', [[1812]]-[[1816]]), the '[[Encyclopedia of Philosophical Sciences]]'' ('Enzyklop'die der philosophischen Wissenschaften',[[1817]], with several subsequent reissues) and the ''Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts'', [[1821])

He was an unrestricted defender of the "Germanic Spirit", which accompanied by Christianity, would be the most advanced of humanity:

"Quote" The Germanic Spirit ('der germanische Geist'') is the Spirit of the New World ('neuen Welt''), whose purpose is the realization of absolute truth, as infinite self-determination of freedom, which has its own absolute form for its own content

This was passed to the climax of the realization of the Spirit, that of the ''True Spirit of Self'' ('Der seiner selbst gewisse Geist') which reaches its most appropriate form in the "absolute philosophy", which is none other than Thatgel's

Work

Hegel's first truly important work is often considered his '[Spirit Phenomenology]'' ([1807]), although his ''Writings of Youth'' – never published in life – among which stands "The Spirit of Christianity and its Destiny", have been the subject of study and interpretation since they came to light in the early twentieth century

The philosophy of Hegel's history is also marked by the concepts of "shrews of reason" and the "joke of history"; history leads men who believe to lead themselves, as individuals and as societies, and punishes their pretensions so that history-world mocks them by producing exact opposite, paradoxical results, to those intended for their authors, although the story is finally reordered and, in a fantastic loop, goes back on itself and with its mockery and sarcastic paradox, turned into a mechanism of encryption, it also creates itself, unintentionally, realities and symbols hidden from the world and accessible only to the cognoscents, that is, those who want to meet

[[Karl Popper]], Hegel's critic in '[Open Society and Its Enemies]',' believes that Hegel's system is a dimly disguised justification for the government of [Frederick William III of Prussia] Frederick William III] and the Hegelian idea that the further objective of history is to reach a state that approaches that of Prussia in the 1831st century
