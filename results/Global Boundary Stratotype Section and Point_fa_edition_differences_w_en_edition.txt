Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point

fa edition's differences with the en version: 


1. 

Since it is usually the universal boundary of the world border, the points and slices are defined by the transition of animal mezzanine, so more animal mezzanine are defined as compared to Gspas. 

2. 
GSSP ' ' is called an international consensus to determine the points of reference to the sections and outcrop of [stratigraphy]], which specifies the underside of a [[Mezzanine (stratigraphy) | mezzanine]] in [[geological time scale]]. 

3. 
Studies and activities determine these points with the guidance of [the International Association of Geology]] which is part of [[international community of Geological knowledge]].
