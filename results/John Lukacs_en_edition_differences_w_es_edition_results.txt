He argues that Hitler's statement in August 1939 to the [[League of Nations]] High Commissioner for Danzig, the Swiss diplomat [[Carl Jacob Burckhardt]] ("Everything I undertake is directed against Russia"), which Hillgruber cited as evidence of Hitler's anti-Soviet intentions, was part of an effort to intimidate Britain and France into abandoning Poland.<ref>Lukacs (1997), p.147.</ref> Lukacs takes issue with Hillgruber's claim that the war against Britain was of "secondary" importance to Hitler compared to the war against the Soviet Union.<ref>Lukacs (1997), p

In ''The Hitler of History'', inspired by the example of [[Pieter Geyl]]'s book, ''Napoleon For and Against'', Lukacs examines the state of Hitler scholarship and offers his own observations about Hitler
0.271909
In Lukacs's view, Hitler was a racist, nationalist, revolutionary and populist.<ref>Lukacs, John The Hitler of History, New York: Vintage Books, 1997, 1998 pages 218-219</ref> Lukacs criticizes [[Marxist]] and liberal historians who claim that the German working class were strongly anti-Nazi and argues that the exact opposite was the case
0.271909
Each chapter of ''The Hitler of History'' is devoted to a particular topic, such as whether Hitler was a reactionary or revolutionary; a nationalist or a racist; and he examines the roots of Hitler's ideology
0.291446
Citing the biographical example of Hitler as well as left- and right-wing populism in the United States, Lukacs also argues in the book that populism was the most destructive force of the 20th century and attempts to disentangle the concept of populism from its frequent (though, Lukacs argues, inaccurate) conflation with the inherent stances of [[left-wing politics]]
