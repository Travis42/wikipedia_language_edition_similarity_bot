==Revisionism and modern work==
"Revisionism" in this context means the rejection of the Orthodox/Marxist model of a revolution carried out by the bourgeoisie against the aristocracy on the right, with intervention from the proletariat pushing it to the left. 

2. 

===Cobb===
Another seminal figure in the revisionism debate is the Francophile Englishman [[Richard Cobb]], who has produced a number of immensely detailed studies of both provincial and city life, avoiding the revisionism debate by "keeping his nose very close to the ground".<ref>David Troyansky, review of Hunt's ''Politics, Culture, and Class''. 

3. 

==Aulard and academic studies==
[[François Victor Alphonse Aulard|Alphonse Aulard]] (1849–1928) was the first professional historian of the Revolution; he promoted graduate studies, scholarly editions, and learned journals.<ref>{{cite book|author1=François Furet and Mona Ozouf, eds.|title=A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bGxiE6jvzOcC&pg=PA886|year=1989|publisher=Harvard UP|pages=881–89}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tendler | first1 = Joseph | year = 2013 | title = Alphonse Aulard Revisited | url = | journal = European Review of History | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 649–69 | doi=10.1080/13507486.2012.763159}}</ref> His appointment to the Sorbonne was promoted and funded by Republicans in the national and Paris governments, but he was not himself involved in party politics. 

4. 
 The old model or paradigm focusing on class conflict has been challenged but no new explanatory model had gained widespread support.<ref>Rebecca L. 

5. 
He also places increased emphasis on insurrectionary violence in Paris and violence in general, claiming that it was "not the unfortunate by-product of revolution, [but] the source of its energy."<ref>Schama, ''Citizens'', ch. 

6. 
 Thus Schama is simultaneously able to deny the existence of a so-called "bourgeois" revolution, reserve apotheoses for Robespierre, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], and the ''[[sans-culottes]]'' alike, and utilize historical nuance to a degree usually associated with more liberal historians. 

7. 
 Written during the Restoration, when the tricolor flag and singing the Marseillaise were forbidden, the book praised the principles, leaders and accomplishments of the 1789 Revolution;  the clear heroes were Mirabeau, Lafayette, and other moderate leaders. 

8. 
The undoubted passion and intensity of the text may also be due to the famous incident where he sent the completed draft of the first volume to [[John Stuart Mill]] for comment, only for Mill's maid to accidentally burn the volume to ashes, forcing Carlyle to start from scratch.

Aulard's books favored the study of parliamentary debates, not action in the street; institutions, not insurrections.

Cobban, ''The Social Interpretation of the French Revolution'' (1963)</ref>

Although dismissed and attacked by the mainstream journals at first, Cobban was persistent and determined, and his approach was soon supported and modified by a flood of new research both inside and outside France. 

12. 
Influenced by socialist politician [[Jean Jaurès]] and historian [[Albert Mathiez]] (who broke with his teacher Aulard regarding class conflict), historians on the left led by [[Georges Lefebvre]] and [[Albert Soboul]] developed this view.

===Furet===
[[François Furet]] (1927–1997) was the leading figure in the rejection of the "classic" or "Marxist" interpretation. 

14. 
He continued to research along these lines, publishing ''The Great Fear of 1789'' (1932, first English translation 1973), about the panic and violence which spread throughout rural France in the summer of 1789.

Tackett also has several works focusing on [[Reign of Terror]], ''The Coming of the Terror in the French Revolution'' (2015), and the psychology behind the paranoia affecting the Committee of Public Safety during the Terror.

Historian [[François Furet]], a leader of the [[Annales School]], argues that his multivolume history remains "the cornerstone of all revolutionary historiography and is also a literary monument."<ref>François Furet, ''Revolutionary France 1770–1880'' (1992), p.
