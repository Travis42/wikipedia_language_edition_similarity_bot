popularizes the nonsense that the Nazis saw in Marxism and bolshevism their main enemy, and the Jews unfortunately got caught up in this; when he links the destruction of the Jews to the ups and downs of German warfare in the Soviet Union, in a book that is so cocksure of itself that it does not need a proper scientific apparatus, he is really engaging in a much more subtle form of Holocaust denial.

He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1944; that same year he was drafted into the [[United States Army]] and served as an intelligence officer.

== Early life and academic career ==
Mayer was born in 1926 into a [[Jews|Jewish]] family that fled to the United States during the [[German occupation of Luxembourg in World War II|Nazi invasion of Luxembourg]] in May 1940.

In 1961, Mayer played a key role in the American publication of Carr's book ''[[What Is History?]]''.<ref name = "Haslam 1999 217">{{Harvnb|Haslam|1999|p=217}}.</ref> Many of Mayer's writings on international affairs in the interwar era take as their starting point Carr's 1939 book ''The Twenty Year's Crisis''. 

11. 
In 2001, after the [[September 11 attacks]], he wrote an essay stating that "since 1947 America has been the chief and pioneering perpetrator of 'preemptive' state terror, exclusively in the Third World and therefore widely dissembled."<ref>{{Cite web|author=Arno Mayer|date=5 October 2001|title=Untimely reflections upon the state of the world|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/01/16/untimely-reflections-upon-the-state-of-the-world/|publisher=[[The Daily Princetonian|dailyprincetonian.com]]|accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref> When interviewed for a 2003 documentary, he described the [[Roman Empire]] as a "tea party" in comparison to its American counterpart.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Gabriele Zamparini; Lorenzo Meccoli|year=2003|title=XXI Century, Part 1: The Dawn|url=http://www.bullfrogfilms.com/catalog/xxid.html|location=Oley, PA|publisher=Bullfrog Films|at={{YouTube|id=dDp_WeHMQjw&t=47m04s|title=47:04}}|quote=It [the American Empire] is an informal empire of the sort that, it seems to me, does not really have a precedent in history.

Such personal bona fides didn't prevent the Anti-Defamation League from including Mayer in its 1993 "Hitler's Apologists: The Anti-Semitic Propaganda of Holocaust Revisionism", where his work is cited as an example of "legitimate historical scholarship which relativizes the genocide of the Jews." Mayer's crime is to "have argued, with no apparent anti-Semitic motivation"—note how the absence of evidence itself becomes incriminating—"that though millions of Jews were killed during WWII, there was actually no premeditated policy for this destruction."<ref name = "Guttenplan 2001 75">{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=75}}.</ref>

Mayer concluded his reflection as follows: "certainly at Auschwitz, but probably overall, more Jews were killed by so-called 'natural' causes than by 'unnatural' ones." This conclusion removed the lingering restraints—if any actually remained—preventing [[David Irving]] from publicly announcing he did not believe the gas chambers at Nazi camps like Auschwitz existed.<ref name = "Pelt 2002 46_48">{{Harvnb|Pelt|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=83dvJxPm--EC&pg=PA46 46–8]}}.</ref> Guttenplan called Mayer's musing on differences between 'natural' and 'unnatural' deaths, even if the terms were deployed in quote marks, "indefensible".<ref name = "Guttenplan 2001 167_168">{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|pp=167–8}}.</ref>

Holocaust deniers have often quoted out of context Mayer's sentences in the book: "Sources for the study of the gas chambers are at once rare and unreliable".<ref name = "She&Gro 2009 126">{{Harvnb|Shermer|Grobman|2009|p=126}}.</ref> As the authors [[Michael Shermer]] and [[Alex Grobman]] have noted, the entire paragraph from which the sentence comes from states that the SS destroyed the majority of the documention relating to the operation of the gas chambers in the death camps, which is why Mayer feels that sources for the operation of the gas chambers are "rare" and "unreliable".<ref name = "She&Gro 2009 126_127">{{Harvnb|Shermer|Grobman|2009|pp=126–7}}.</ref>

Anti-Semitism did not play a decisive or even significant role in the growth of the Nazi movement and electorate.

In a largely favorable review, the British writer [[Geoffrey Wheatcroft]] called ''Plowshares into Swords'' an enlightening account of Israeli history that traces such figures as [[Martin Buber]], [[Judah Magnes]], [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] and, perhaps unexpectedly, [[Vladimir Jabotinsky]] and critiques the "chauvinistic and brutalising tendencies of Zionism".<ref name="Wheatcroft">{{Cite web|author=Geoffrey Wheatcroft|author-link=Geoffrey Wheatcroft|date=2 October 2008|title=Never criticise the family|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2008/10/israel-jewish-zionism-jews|publisher=[[New Statesman|newstatesman.com]]|accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref> In a negative review of the book, British scholar [[Simon Goldhill]]{{citation needed|date=March 2017|reason=review is unsigned}} said it was of little value as history and criticized Mayer for his political bias, arguing that Mayer ignored Arab acts and media rhetoric against Jewish settlers and Israelis, falsely portrayed the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 as a "calculated imperialist plot", claimed that all Western criticism of the Islamic world for human rights issues is nothing more than self-interested and described Arab feeling toward Jews buying property in Palestine in the 1920s as "righteous anger".<ref>{{Cite web|author= |authorlink=|date=13 November 2008|title="Plowshares into Swords: From Zionism to Israel" (review)| url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/404319.article|publisher=[[Times Higher Education|timeshighereducation.co.uk]]| accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref>

He has taught at [[Princeton University]] since 1961.<ref name="786-787"/>

== Views ==
A self-proclaimed "left dissident Marxist", Mayer's major interests are in [[modernization theory]] and what he calls "The Thirty Years' Crisis" between 1914 and 1945.<ref name="786-787">{{Harvnb|Boyd|1999|pp=786–7}}.</ref> Mayer posits that Europe was characterized in the 19th century by a rapid modernization in the economic field by [[industrialization]] and retardation in the political field.<ref name="786-787"/> He has argued that what he refers to as "The Thirty Years' Crisis" was caused by the problems of a dynamic new society produced by industrialization facing a rigid political order.<ref name="786-787"/> He feels that the [[aristocracy]] in all of the European countries held far too much power, and it was their efforts to keep power that led to [[World War I]], the rise of [[fascism]], [[World War II]], and the Holocaust.<ref name="786-787"/>

In a 1967 essay "The Primacy of Domestic Politics", Mayer made a ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' ("primacy of domestic politics") argument for the origins of World War I.

According to Mayer, the original German plan was to defeat the Soviet Union, and then to deport all the [[Soviet Jews]] to a [[Internment|reservation]] behind the [[Urals]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wegner|1997|p=225}}.</ref>

In regards to the [[functionalism versus intentionalism|functionalist-intentionalist divide]] that once pervaded Holocaust [[historiography]], Mayer's work can be seen as a bridge between the two schools.<ref name = "Baldwin 1990 25_26">{{Harvnb|Baldwin|1990|pp=25–6}}.</ref> Mayer argues that there was no masterplan for genocide, and that the Holocaust cannot be explained solely in regards to Hitler's [[world view]].<ref name = "Baldwin 1990 25_26"/> At the same time, Mayer does agree with intentionalist historians such as [[Andreas Hillgruber]] (with whom Mayer otherwise has little in common) in seeing [[Operation Barbarossa]], and the Nazi crusade to annihilate "Judeo-Bolshevism" as the key development in the genesis of the "Final Solution to the Jewish Question".<ref name = "Baldwin 1990 26"/>
