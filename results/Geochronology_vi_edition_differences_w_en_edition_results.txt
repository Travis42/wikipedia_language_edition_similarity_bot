[[The tribe]]) extends from 260.4 ± 0.7 Ma (Ma = million years ago) (fossils of the oldest known tribe) until about 250.1 ± 0.4 Ma (fossil belongs to [[Triassic | triassic)] The oldest known)-a gap in fossil-era combinations that have been known to roughly 10 Ma

While the upper reaches of the Upper Permian, it can be represented as a coherence, the true dating of the rock can be anywhere between 260 and 251 Ma

Example:
* True: ' ' [[Tyrannosaurus]] Rex ' ' lived in [[Cretaceous | Cretaceous]] late, meaning it lived about 68-65 million years ago
0.0721336
* False: ' ' Tyrannosaurus Rex ' ' lives in the Upper Cretaceous, meaning that it lives in the rock layers of the upper White Cretaceous

The Earth science is the most important instrument used in the areas of [[the geometrical period]], in which it is attempted to determine the absolute era for every fossil complex and to determine the geological history of [[Earth]] as well as those of extraterrestrial celestial bodies

{{primary | radiouniform age}}
By measuring the amount [[radioactive decay]] of [[radioactive isotopes]] with the known [[Half-life]], geomeators can establish the absolute era of the parent material

These techniques define the dating of the [[[] Variable rock], [[Volcanic Rock (geology) |] and [[volcanic rock]]
0.165647
A range of radioactive isotopes is used for this purpose, and depends on the rate of decay, which is used to determine the era of various geological era
0.171791
The ' direct ' stratification ' is given the absolute age determination of the stone that simply puts it in a ' ' roughly ' period of time that at that time the fossil complex is known to have coexist

The techniques of [[the] incremental dating]] allow for the generation of annual tables for years in the net, in which they can be fixed (i.e., link to today and hence the time of [schedule]] or [[Astronomical time]]) or floating

[[Heat]] and [[optical stimulation]] are used in archaeology to determine the era of ' burnt ' objects such as pottery or cooked rocks and can be used to observe the movement of [[sand]]
