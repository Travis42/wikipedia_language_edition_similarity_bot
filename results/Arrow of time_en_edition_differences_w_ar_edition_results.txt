Certain subatomic interactions involving the [[weak nuclear force]] violate the conservation of both [[Parity (physics)|parity]] and [[charge conjugation]], but only very rarely

According to one physical view of [[wave function collapse]], the theory of [[quantum decoherence]], the quantum arrow of time is a consequence of the [[Entropy (arrow of time)|thermodynamic arrow of time]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

[[Relational quantum mechanics]] proposes that there is no such thing as an absolute wave function collapse, and that what an observer sees as wave function collapse is in fact the observer becoming entangled with the measured state

If as we follow the arrow we find more and more of the random element in the state of the world, then the arrow is pointing towards the future; if the random element decreases the arrow points towards the past

== Eddington ==
In the 1928 book ''The Nature of the Physical World'', which helped to popularize the concept, Eddington stated:

<blockquote>Let us draw an arrow arbitrarily
0.162248
The thermodynamic arrow is an increase in entanglement over time; in this way, relational quantum mechanics relates the quantum arrow to the thermodynamic arrow
0.222988
I shall use the phrase 'time's arrow' to express this one-way property of time which has no analogue in space.</blockquote>

Eddington then gives three points to note about this arrow:

# It is vividly recognized by [[consciousness]]
0.222988

That the combination of parity and charge conjugation is broken so rarely means that this arrow only "barely" points in one direction, setting it apart from the other arrows whose direction is much more obvious
