Geological history of Earth

en edition's differences with the hi version: 


1. 

==== Triassic Period ====
{{Main|Triassic}}
The '''Triassic''' Period extends from about 252.17 ± 0.06 to 201.3 ± 0.2 Ma.<ref name="ICS2015" />  During the [[Triassic]], almost all the Earth's land mass was concentrated into a single [[supercontinent]] centered more or less on the equator, called [[Pangaea]] ("all the land"). 

2. 
Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts, raising [[sea level|eustatic sea levels]] worldwide. 

3. 
The Tethys Sea, which had separated the northern continents from Africa and India, began to close up, forming the [[Mediterranean sea]]. 

4. 
In Europe, the [[Tethys Sea]] finally vanished, while the uplift of the [[Alps]] isolated its final remnant, the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and created another shallow sea with island [[archipelago]]s to the north. 

5. 
However, the field strength was lower than at present and the [[magnetosphere]] was about half the modern radius.<ref>{{cite news | author=Staff | title=Oldest measurement of Earth's magnetic field reveals battle between Sun and Earth for our atmosphere | date=March 4, 2010 | work=Physorg.news | url=http://www.physorg.com/news186922627.html | accessdate=2010-03-27 }}</ref>

=== Proterozoic Eon ===
{{Main|Proterozoic}}
The geologic record of the Proterozoic ({{Ma|2500|541}}) is more complete than that for the preceding [[Archean]]. 

6. 

==== Devonian Period ====
{{Main|Devonian}}
The '''Devonian''' spanned roughly from 419 to 359 Ma.<ref name="ICS2015" />  The period was a time of great tectonic activity, as [[Laurasia]] and Gondwana drew closer together. 

7. 

==== Neogene Period ====
{{Main|Neogene}}
The '''Neogene''' Period is a unit of [[geologic timescale|geologic time]] starting 23.03 Ma.<ref name="ICS2015" /> and ends at 2.588 Ma. 

8. 

==== Carboniferous Period ====
{{Main|Carboniferous}}
The '''Carboniferous''' extends from about 358.9 ± 0.4 to about 298.9 ± 0.15 Ma.<ref name="ICS2015" />

A global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the [[Carboniferous]]; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]]. 

9. 
Subsequent uplift of mountains in the western [[Mediterranean]] region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea resulting in the [[Messinian salinity crisis]] near the end of the Miocene. 

10. 
The sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea. 

11. 
The Jurassic geological record is good in western [[Europe]], where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the [[Jurassic Coast]] [[World Heritage Site]] and the renowned late Jurassic ''[[lagerstätte]]n'' of [[Holzmaden]] and [[Solnhofen limestone|Solnhofen]].<ref name=lasdjur>{{cite web

In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/geology/legend/ages/jurassic.html |title=Jurassic Rocks – 208 to 146 million years ago |accessdate= 2007-07-19 |work=nationalatlas.gov |publisher=United States Department of the Interior |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930212425/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/geology/legend/ages/jurassic.html |archivedate=2014-09-30 }}</ref> Though the [[Epeiric Sea|epicontinental]] [[Sundance Sea]] left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the [[alluvium|alluvial]] deposits of the [[Morrison Formation]]. 

12. 

==== Paleogene Period ====
{{Main|Paleogene}}
The '''Paleogene''' (alternatively '''Palaeogene''') [[geologic period|Period]] is a unit of [[geologic time]] that began {{period start|Paleogene}} and ended 23.03 Ma<ref name="ICS2015" /> and comprises the first part of the [[Cenozoic]] Era. 

13. 
In addition, many areas above about [[40th parallel north|40 degrees north]] latitude had been depressed by the weight of the Pleistocene [[glacier]]s and rose as much as {{convert|180|m|ft|0}} over the late Pleistocene and Holocene, and are still rising today.

==== Jurassic Period ====
{{Main|Jurassic}}
The '''Jurassic''' Period extends from about 201.3 ± 0.2 to 145.0 Ma.<ref name="ICS2015" />
During the early [[Jurassic]], the supercontinent [[Pangaea]] broke up into the northern supercontinent [[Laurasia]] and the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]]; the [[Gulf of Mexico]] opened in the new rift between North America and what is now [[Mexico]]'s [[Yucatan Peninsula]]. 

15. 
All the deep-ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through [[subduction]] of oceanic plates; thus, very little is known of the Triassic open ocean.

Because of the limited shoreline of one super-continental mass, Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare; despite their prominence in [[Western Europe]], where the Triassic was first studied. 

17. 

==== Quaternary Period ====
{{Main|Quaternary}}

===== Pleistocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Pleistocene}}
The '''Pleistocene''' extends from {{Ma|2.588}} to 11,700 years before present.<ref name="ICS2015" />  The modern [[continent]]s were essentially at their present positions during the [[Pleistocene]], the [[tectonic plate|plates]] upon which they sit probably having moved no more than {{convert|100|km|mi|0}} relative to each other since the beginning of the period. 

18. 
[[File:Pangea animation 03.gif|thumb|Pangaea separation animation]]

==== Permian Period ====
{{Main|Permian}}
The '''Permian''' extends from about 298.9 ± 0.15 to 252.17 ± 0.06 Ma.<ref name="ICS2015" />

During the [[Permian]] all the Earth's major land masses, except portions of East Asia, were collected into a single supercontinent known as [[Pangaea]]. 

19. 

==== Cretaceous Period ====
{{Main|Cretaceous}}
[[File:100 global.png|thumb|Plate tectonics- 100 Ma,<ref name="ICS2015" /> [[Cretaceous]] period]]
The '''Cretaceous''' Period extends from circa {{Ma|145.0}} to {{Ma|Paleogene}}.<ref name="ICS2015" />

During the [[Cretaceous]], the late [[Paleozoic]]-early Mesozoic [[supercontinent]] of [[Pangaea]] completed its breakup into present day [[continent]]s, although their positions were substantially different at the time. 

20. 
Gondwana started the period in the equatorial latitudes and, as the period progressed, drifted toward the South Pole. 

21. 
 The Neogene Period follows the [[Paleogene]] Period. 

22. 

In contrast to the [[Proterozoic]], Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments, such as [[graywacke]]s, [[mudstone]]s, volcanic sediments and [[banded iron formation]]s. 

23. 
The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in [[sea level]]s, recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments, forming an [[unconformity]]. 

24. 

==== Ordovician period ====
{{Main|Ordovician}}
The '''Ordovician''' period started at a major extinction event called the [[Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event]] some time about 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma.<ref name="ICS2015"/>  During the [[Ordovician]] the southern continents were collected into a single continent called Gondwana. 

25. 
More recent potassium isotopic studies suggest that the Moon was formed by a smaller, high-energy, high-angular-momentum giant impact cleaving off a significant portion of the Earth.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Wang |first1=K.|last2=Jacobsen|first2=S.B.|title=Potassium isotopic evidence for a high-energy giant impact origin of the Moon|journal=Nature|date=Sep 12, 2016|doi=10.1038/nature19341 |volume=538|issue=7626|pages=487–490|pmid=27617635|bibcode=2016Natur.538..487W}}</ref> Outgassing and [[Volcano|volcanic]] activity produced the primordial atmosphere.

Major volcanic events altering the Earth's environment and causing extinctions may have occurred 10 times in the past 3 billion years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-rsquo-s-lost-history-of-planet-altering-eruptions-revealed/?WT.mc_id=SA_FB_ENGYSUS_NEWS|title=Earth's Lost History of Planet-Altering Eruptions Revealed|last=Witze|first=Alexandra|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en}}</ref>

=== Hadean Eon ===
{{Main|Hadean}}
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Artist's conception of a [[protoplanetary disc]]]]
During Hadean time (4.6&ndash;4 [[annum|Ga]]), the [[Solar System]] was forming, probably within a large cloud of gas and dust around the sun, called an [[accretion disc]] from which [[History of Earth#Origin|Earth formed]] {{Ma|4500}}.<ref name="age_earth">{{cite book | first=G.B. 

27. 

=== Cenozoic Era ===
{{Main|Cenozoic}}
The '''Cenozoic''' Era covers the {{period start|Cenozoic}}&nbsp;million years since the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] up to and including the present day. 

28. 
Earth formed [[Age of the Earth|about 4.54 billion years ago]] by accretion from the [[solar nebula]], a disk-shaped mass of dust and gas left over from the formation of the Sun, which also created the rest of the [[Solar System]]. 

29. 
Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid [[crust (geology) |crust]] when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. 

30. 
The high-grade rocks were derived from volcanic [[island arc]]s, while the low-grade metamorphic rocks represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island rocks and deposited in a [[forearc|forearc basin]]. 

31. 

The Ordovician came to a close in a series of [[extinction event]]s that, taken together, comprise the second-largest of the five major extinction events in [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] in terms of percentage of [[genus|genera]] that became extinct. 

32. 
The first nonmarine sediments in the [[rift]] that marks the initial break-up of Pangea&mdash;which separated [[New Jersey]] from [[Morocco]]&mdash;are of Late Triassic age; in the U.S., these thick sediments comprise the [[Newark Supergroup]].<ref name=lasdtri>{{cite web

33. 
In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean, the Proterozoic features many [[stratum|strata]] that were laid down in extensive shallow [[Epeiric Sea|epicontinental seas]]; furthermore, many of these rocks are less [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]] than Archean-age ones, and plenty are unaltered.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|p=315}}</ref> Study of these rocks show that the eon featured massive, rapid [[continent]]al accretion (unique to the Proterozoic), [[supercontinent cycle]]s, and wholly modern [[orogeny|orogenic]] activity.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=315&ndash;318, 329&ndash;332}}</ref> Roughly {{Ma|750}},<ref name="ICS2008">[https://www.webcitation.org/5nDdmUWXk?url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/upload/ISChart2008.pdf International Stratigraphic Chart 2008, International Commission on Stratigraphy]</ref> the earliest-known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. 

34.

35. 
The present pattern of [[ice age]]s began about {{Ma|40}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The northern [[supercontinent]] of [[Laurasia]] began to break up, as [[Europe]], [[Greenland]] and [[North America]] drifted apart.

[[File:Geologic Clock with events and periods.svg|thumb|right|325px|Geologic time represented in a diagram called a geological clock, showing the relative lengths of the eons of Earth's history and noting major events]]
The '''geological history of Earth''' follows the major events in Earth's past based on the [[geological time scale]], a system of [[Chronological dating|chronological measurement]] based on the study of the planet's rock layers ([[stratigraphy]]).

Condensing [[water vapor]], augmented by ice delivered from [[comet]]s, [[Origin of water on Earth|produced the oceans]]. 

39. 
The [[solar wind]] flux was about 100 times the value of the modern [[Sun]], so the presence of the magnetic field helped prevent the planet's atmosphere from being stripped away, which is what probably happened to the [[atmosphere of Mars]].
