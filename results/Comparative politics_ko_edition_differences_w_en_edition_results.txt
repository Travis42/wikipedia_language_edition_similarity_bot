The selection criteria of the "comparable system" also take importance on regional factors as of now, but it is also necessary to include a system that is located in other regions but has a lot of personal similarities

In the post-war liberal trend, many emerging countries that adopted the parliamentary system suffered frequent political changes in serious absurdities and contradictions just a decade later, eventually causing the actual disruption of the parliamentary system

The books pointed out above are ambitious achievements that rely on the classification equation to target dozens of political systems, with the exception of "civic culture," or at least to be embraced, but the feasibility of classification is still not being addressed
4.54747e-11
In other words, it is expected that more methods should be utilized to organize the theory in the study between a limited number of comparable systems, and to prove it in a statistical way to target a larger number

For example, [[The United States]] · [Brazil]· If we are to compare the presidential system with the parliamentary system of [Germany], there are too many aspects that are not explained with the constitution albeit the constitution of this political system

Only if the establishment of such a lieutenant theory is effective, the path to general theory can be more robust as a comprehensive consideration to obtain the first castle from the observation of social behavior and own the dominant conceptual pattern

In other words, while past comparisons describe the functions of the government of the democratic political system, reveal the superiority of the system, and compared to the non-democratic system, the normative and value-oriented (or prejudiced) comparison to evaluate the democratic system, and today's comparative studies appear as a procedure or a pact that inevitably follows the establishment of a lieutenant theory or general theory of the political phenomenon
0.206243
The comparison in this case deals with the non-democratic political system for the purpose of showing or evaluating the superiority of the democratic political system rather than attempting to classify the political system as a fact, and objectively saving the characteristics of each system, and therefore does not give much meaning to the comparison itself

The situation in the emerging country of the 1960s was shocking to Western political scientists, who had a relaxed and optimistic view of the prospects of a post-war new country, as if western scholars in the early 20th century had been shocked by the collapse of the Weimar Republic, as if all political systems would inevitably pursue democratic politics

For example, one example would be to define democracy as the best political system based on natural law ideas and social contractual theory, and then prepare for an undemocratic political system to support it

Two factors that led to a significant change in this trend are the great shocks of the fascism and the communist political system that emerged in the 1920s and 30s, and the other is the emerging political system of non-Western societies, which emerged in the form of a variety of after-world post-War periods

This is because it is more certain that it is more certain that it can be verified or verified by a large number of political systems rather than confined to a single political system or a small political system to verify the validity (proof) of the theory, rather than simply broadening the horizon

As this is a new trend in comparative politics, the political phenomenon is understood as a broad phenomenon that includes informal forces or quasi-political groups and institutions rather than the official system of government as in the past, and it is important to compare the practical meaning semantics of non-Western society, not the comparison of western political systems as in the past

In other words, if the theory is to save the relationship between all political systems with a broad cultural context, and the relationship between factors acting on the regular and stable phenomena (or variables) that appear in the political phenomenon of various personalities, the comparative method is that it can be called a procedure and finesse indispensable to this theory

This trend became the mainstream of comparative politics by the 20th century, and in particular, the interest of political scientists from Young and The United States was focused on comparing the form of government in Western society with a democratic political system as the most ideal form of government, and the assumption that all political systems would ultimately undergo a straight-forward evolutionary process toward this ideal system

The study of political development naturally appeared to be an interest in seeking the key to the creation or growth of conditions necessary to bring a more desirable political order to the new country, and the answer to "what is a desirable political order" may vary from person to person
0.243955
The problem raised by the political unrest in the new country was the need for a new life on the issue between the political system and the social structure, and the need to rethink the "competence" of the new country's political system, which is not being swept up in the modernization process and cannot control or induce it

As the political system emphasizes the cultural context, comparative political studies have become more important in the fact that it is the culuture that shapes the values and mindsets of its members, and that each member's personal ities reflect the culture

As so far, comparative political studies have sought to regard international political factors as an anti-water, but international political studies have tended to regard the political system as an anti-water, but this view is gradually losing its validity
