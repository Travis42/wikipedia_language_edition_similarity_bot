Cosmic Calendar

es edition's differences with the en version: 


1. 

This scale was popularized by the astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] in his book '[[The Dragons of Eden]'' and in the television series '[Cosmos: A Personal Journey' Cosmos]]'', which he presented. 

2. 
* December 27: first [[birds]], first [[flower].es. 

3. 
In this calendar, the [[solar system] appears only on September 9, life on [[Earth]] arises on the 30th of that month, the first [[dinosaur] appears on December 25, and the first [[primates]] on December 30. 

4. 
The most primitive ''[Homo sapiens]'' appear ten minutes before midnight on the last day of the year, and the entire history of mankind occupies only the last 21 seconds. 

5. 

In the 2014 sequel series, ''[Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey]'', the host [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] presents the same concept of a cosmic calendar, but using the revised age of the universe of 13&nbsp;800 million years<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140311104905/http://www.hulu.com/watch/604551 Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey ('27min']] </ref>as an improvement on Sagan's 1980 figure of 15&amp;nbsp;000 million years. 

6. 

The Birth of Life
* October 2nd: Life on Earth. 

7. 
Sagan goes on to extend the comparison in terms of surface, explaining that if the Cosmic Calendar scales to the size of a football field, then, "all human history would occupy an area the size of [his] hand." <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa1ImgOcOPM&t=53m38s ]</ref>

Cosmic Day

Big Bang
* January 1: The Big Bang happens. 

8. 
[[Archive:Cosmic Calendar.png-thumb-right-550px- To describe the history of the universe, the model of the cosmic calendar posed by [[Carl Sagan], takes the 'Big Bang' as a starting point, placing its origin approximately 13&nbsp;800 million years, and that the history of the universe takes a time scale equivalent to a terrestrial year, as was popularized by Carl Sagan. 

9. 
On this scale, there are 438 years per second, 1,580,000 years per hour, and 37'800,000 years per day. 

10. 
According to the above, on this scale the Big Bang takes place on January 1 at midnight, the current time is December 31 at midnight, and the longest human life is a blink of an eye (about 1/4th of a second).]]

The ''cosmic calendar'' is a scale on which the lifespan of the [universe]] is extrapolated to an annual calendar; that is, the [Big Bang] took place on the 1st of cosmic, exactly at midnight and the current moment is midnight on 31 December. 

11. 
* December 31, time 23.59.50: end of [[prehistory]] and beginning of history, [[Archaic Dynastic Period-Dynasties in Sumeria]], [[Ebla]] and [[Chronology of Ancient Egypt] Egypt]], the [[astronomy]Ia]]
* December 31, hour 23.59.51: the [[alphabet]] and the wheel are invented, [[Empire Akkadian]].
