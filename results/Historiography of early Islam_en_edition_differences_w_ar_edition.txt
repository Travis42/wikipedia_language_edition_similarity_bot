Historiography of early Islam

It is worthwhile pointing out that [[caliph]] [[Umar]] bin al-Khattāb died on the last night of the month of Dhūl-Hijjah of the year 23 [[Hijri year|AH]], and was buried next day on the first day of Muharram of the new year 24 AH, corresponding to 644 CE.

Because narratives regarding Muhammad and his [[Sahaba|companions]] came from various sources, it was necessary to verify which sources were more reliable. 

7. 
They tried to correct or reconstruct the early history of Islam from other, presumably more reliable, sources -- such as coins, inscriptions, and non-Islamic sources.

Wansbrough's scepticism influenced a number of younger scholars, including:

* [[Martin Hinds]] (1941–1988)
* [[Patricia Crone]] (1945-2015)
* [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]] (1940- )

In 1977 Crone and Cook published ''[[Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World]]'', which argued that the traditional early history of Islam is a [[myth]], generated ''after'' the Arab conquests of Egypt, Syria, and Persia to give a solid ideological foundation to the new Arab regimes in those lands. 

9. 
Al-Bukhari's [[historical method]]s of testing hadiths and [[isnad]]s is seen as the beginning of the method of [[citation]] and a precursor to the [[scientific method]]. 

10. 

The "[[science of hadith]]" is the process that Muslim scholars use to evaluate [[hadith]]. 

11. 

Crone defended the use of non-Muslim sources saying that "of course these sources are hostile [to the conquering Muslims] and from a classical Islamic view they have simply got everything wrong; but unless we are willing to entertain the notion of an all-pervading literary conspiracy between the non-Muslim peoples of the Middle East, the crucial point remains that they have got things wrong on very much the same points."<ref name=crone-slaves-15>Crone, P., ''Slaves on Horses'', Cambridge, 1980, 15-16</ref>

Crone and Cook's more recent work has involved intense scrutiny of early Islamic sources, but not their total rejection. 

12. 
Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle superstition and uncritical acceptance of historical data." As a result, he introduced a [[scientific method]] to the study of history, which was considered something "new to his age", and he often referred to it as his "new science", now associated with [[historiography]].<ref>[[Ibn Khaldun]], Franz Rosenthal, N. 

13. 
In 1991, Patricia Crone and Michael Cook disavowed a portion of the views that they presented in this book<ref>{{cite book|title=Political Islam: Essays from Middle East Report |location=Los Angeles, California |publisher=University of California Press |year=1997 |page= 47}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=David Waines |title=Introduction to Islam |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontois0000wain |url-access=registration |location=Cambridge, Eng. 

14. 
''Hagarism'' contends that looking at the early non-Islamic sources provides a much different picture of early Islamic history than the later Islamic sources do (some of the sources provide an account of early Islam which significantly contradicts the traditional Islamic accounts of two centuries later). 

15. 
In order to evaluate these sources, various methodologies were developed, such as the "science of [[biography]]", "[[science of hadith]]" and "[[Isnad]]" (chain of transmission). 

16. 

[[Ilm ar-Rijal]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]) is the "science of biography" especially as practiced in Islam, where it was first applied to the [[Sirah Rasul Allah|sira]], the life of the [[prophet]] of Islam, Muhammad, and then the lives of the four [[Rightly Guided Caliphs]] who expanded Islamic dominance rapidly.

=== The revisionist challenge ===
In the 1970s the [[Revisionist School of Islamic Studies]], or what has been described as a "wave of sceptical scholars",<ref>Donner 1998 p.&nbsp;23</ref> challenged a great deal of the received wisdom in Islamic studies.

== Scholars combining traditional and academic scholarship ==
A few scholars have managed{{according to whom|date=November 2014}} to bridge the divide between Islamic and Western-style secular scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} They have completed both Islamic and Western academic training.

They argue that "Islam was like other religions, the product of a religious ''evolution''".<ref name=crone-slaves-15/> The idea that there was an abrupt "discontinuity between the pre-Islamic and Islamic worlds",  from Persian and Byzantine civilization to Islamic religion, governance, culture "strains the imagination", but if "we begin by assuming that there must have been some continuity, we need either go beyond the Islamic sources or ...

The '''historiography of early Islam''' refers to the [[Historiography|historiogaphic study]] of the early [[history of Islam]] during the [[7th century]], 
from [[Muhammad]]'s first revelations in 610 until the disintegration of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] in 661, 
and arguably throughout the 8th century and the  duration of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], terminating in the incipient [[Islamic Golden Age]] around the beginning of the 9th century.

In their study of the traditional Islamic accounts of the early conquest of different cities -- Damascus and Caesarea in Syria, Babilyn/al-Fusat and Alexandria in Egypt, Tustar in Khuzistan and Cordoba in Spain -- scholars [[Albrecht Noth]] and [[Lawrence Conrad]] find a suspicious pattern whereby the cities "are all described as having fallen into the hands of the Muslims in precisely the same fashion".

The earliest surviving Islamic biography is Ibn Ishaq's ''[[Sirat Rasul Allah]]'', written in the 8th century, but known to us only from later quotes and recensions (9th–10th century).

===Historiography, cultural history, and philosophy of history===
{{further information|Tarikh}}

The first detailed studies on the subject of [[historiography]] itself and the first critiques on [[historical method]]s appeared in the works of the [[Arab]] [[Muslim]] historian and historiographer [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332–1406), who is regarded as the father of [[historiography]], [[cultural history]],<ref>Mohamad Abdalla (Summer 2007).
