Complexity of counting extra seconds
Autonomous clocks, including calendar clocks, ignore the extra second because it is not entered on a calendar basis and it is impossible to program the schedule in advance

Instead, it was suggested every 6,000 years to add one hour to the world-coordinated time<ref>.http://www.rg.ru/2015/06/30/sekunda-anons.html The last day of June will be one second longer </ref> (there were estimates by researchers that the discrepancy could reach one hour within a few hundred years http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4420084.stm<ref> </ref>)

In November 2015, the possibility of cancelling extra seconds was considered at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-15), the international regulatory body responsible for overriding UTC<ref> http://www.itu.int/net/pressoffice/press_releases/2015/Advisory-08.aspx#.Vo-vmraLSt8 itU World Radiocommunication Conference set for Geneva, 2-27 November 2015

The International Earth Rotation Service IERS reported in its bulletins:

After years of discussions, the proposal for a radical redefinition of the World Coordinated Time UTC came to the final vote in January 2012Yes, the International Radio Advisory Committee ITU-R) in Geneva

The designers risked and trusted UTC, resulting in the addition of an extra second on the night of June 30 to July 1, 1997, and the additional adjustment of the internal clock led to the inaccessibility of the navigation system for users for the day<ref>.</ref> lenta.ru https://lenta.ru/articles/2012/01/23/utc/|publisher'

Possible cancellation of additional seconds
In 2009, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) proposed to abandon the practice of introducing extra seconds - the Earth's rotation is slowing down, and the correction will have to be carried out more often

As a result, in the future, additional seconds will need to be introduced more and more often, in each next century will need to enter about 64 seconds more than in the previous
