Cultural studies has also embraced the examination of race, gender, and other aspects of identity, as is illustrated, for example, by a number of key books published collectively under the name of [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] in the late 1970s and early 80s, including ''Women Take Issue: Aspects of Women's Subordination'' (1978), and ''The Empire Strikes Back: Race and Racism in 70s Britain'' (1982)

Judith Butler, an American feminist theorist whose work is often associated with cultural studies, wrote that

<blockquote>the move from a [[Structuralism|structuralist]] account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure

In some of its variants, then, cultural studies has thus shifted the analytical focus from (traditional understandings of) production to consumption, which is nevertheless understood as a form of production (of meanings, of identities, etc.) in its own right

For example, a study of a [[subculture]] (such as white working class youth in London) would consider their social practices against those of the dominant culture (in this example, the middle and upper classes in London who control the political and financial sectors that create policies affecting the well-being of white working class youth in London)

==Issues, concepts and approaches==

===Marxism, feminism, race and culture===
As noted above, Marxism has been an important influence upon cultural studies
0.071922

In the late 1990s, "restructuring" at the [[University of Birmingham]] led to the elimination of [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] and the creation of a new Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology (CSS) in 1999

 For example, when Stuart Hall left [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] at Birmingham, it was to accept a prestigious professorship in Sociology at the Open University in Britain

 By the 1970s, the work of [[Louis Althusser]] radically rethought the Marxist account of "base" and "superstructure" in ways that had a significant influence on the "Birmingham School."  Much of the work done at [[The Birmingham School|CCCS]] studied youth subcultural expressions of antagonism toward "respectable" middle-class British culture in the post-WWII period

The recent turn of many "progressive" or "leftist" academic humanists and social scientists toward one or another form of epistemic relativism betrays this worthy heritage and undermines the already fragile prospects for progressive social critique

Cultural studies seeks to understand how meaning is generated, disseminated, contested, bound up with systems of power and control, and produced from the social, political and economic spheres within a particular social formation or conjuncture
