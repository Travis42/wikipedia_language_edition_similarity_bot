How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

[[The tribe]]) extends from 260.4 ± 0.7 Ma (Ma = million years ago) (fossils of the oldest known tribe) until about 250.1 ± 0.4 Ma (fossil belongs to [[Triassic | triassic)] The oldest known)-a gap in fossil-era combinations that have been known to roughly 10 Ma.

4. 
While the upper reaches of the Upper Permian, it can be represented as a coherence, the true dating of the rock can be anywhere between 260 and 251 Ma. 

5. 
Example:
* True: ' ' [[Tyrannosaurus]] Rex ' ' lived in [[Cretaceous | Cretaceous]] late, meaning it lived about 68-65 million years ago. 

6. 
* False: ' ' Tyrannosaurus Rex ' ' lives in the Upper Cretaceous, meaning that it lives in the rock layers of the upper White Cretaceous. 

7. 

The Earth science is the most important instrument used in the areas of [[the geometrical period]], in which it is attempted to determine the absolute era for every fossil complex and to determine the geological history of [[Earth]] as well as those of extraterrestrial celestial bodies.

* The technique of [[radioactive isotopes] radioactivity |] measures the decay of [[radiated isotopes]] and other radiation-arising activities.

Its defining range is from the next few years to about 700,000 years.

{{primary | radiouniform age}}
By measuring the amount [[radioactive decay]] of [[radioactive isotopes]] with the known [[Half-life]], geomeators can establish the absolute era of the parent material. 

14. 
These techniques define the dating of the [[[] Variable rock], [[Volcanic Rock (geology) |] and [[volcanic rock]]. 

15. 
A range of radioactive isotopes is used for this purpose, and depends on the rate of decay, which is used to determine the era of various geological era. 

16. 
The ' direct ' stratification ' is given the absolute age determination of the stone that simply puts it in a ' ' roughly ' period of time that at that time the fossil complex is known to have coexist.

= = = Increment = = =
The techniques of [[the] incremental dating]] allow for the generation of annual tables for years in the net, in which they can be fixed (i.e., link to today and hence the time of [schedule]] or [[Astronomical time]]) or floating. 

18. 
[[Heat]] and [[optical stimulation]] are used in archaeology to determine the era of ' burnt ' objects such as pottery or cooked rocks and can be used to observe the movement of [[sand]].
