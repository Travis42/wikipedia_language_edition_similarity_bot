es edition's differences with the en version: 


1. 
The branches of Theology are [[natural theology]] or rational, [[dogmatic theology]] and revealed and [[moral theology]]. 

2. 

Two widespread contemporary distinctions, which merely designate currents of thought and not disciplinary fields, are [[Liberation Theology]] and [[Negative Theology]]. 

3. 
The auxiliary sciences of Geography are multiple, from the Geography of the Earth and even application concretes such as those relating to biology, culture or tourism...., but they have special status the [[Cartography]] and the [[Landscape]], both of great humanistic relief. 

4. 
The classification of major disciplinary areas or fields of particular Philologies is highly nurtured; includes, mainly: [[Egyptology]], [[Indology]], [[Sinology]], [[Niponology]], [[Koreanology]], as well as [[Arabicism]] or Arabic Philology or Semitic Philology, [[Africanism]], Biblical Philology or [[Scrituity]], and [[Classic Philology]]] or ancient Greek and Latin, The enormous development of particular philologies makes the distinction of Modern Philology desishable to the aforementioned Classical and opts for the necessary successive distinction of individuals, among them, above all, [[German Philology]] or Germanistic, [[English Philology]] or Anglo-American, [[Slavic Philology]] or Slavistic, [[Romanesque Philology]] or Romanistic, which in turn includes the complete neo-Latin family: French Philology, [[Italian Philology]], Romanian Philology, Portuguese Philology (and its variants) Galicia) or Galaico-Portuguese. 

5. 
<ref>Like Comparative Philology or Comparative Education, Comparative Law, but also, example worth, Comparative Anatomy.</ref>

Under the recent name of [[Biblioteconomy]], or Biblioteconomy and Archivistics and Documentation, an autonomous auxiliary discipline is currently aimed at discriminating against the traditional philological methodologies born in the [[School of Alexandria]].

Philology or Philological Sciences

The great scientific-humanistic series configured by [[Philology]] outlines both the most extensive concatenation of human science fields and the more technical outline of its methodology. 

8. 
Ancient and classicist aesthetics define an intermingled knowledge, as is prototypically seen in Plato's work; modern Aesthetics, especially from English Empiricism, Baumgarten and, above all, Kant's 'Critical of Judgment', is configured as an autonomous discipline detached from Ethics, which was discussed immediately, and effectively reworked by [[Friedrich Schiller], through his aesthetic arguments about anthropologically well-founded freedom. 

9. 

Within the Romanesque Philology has special dimension the [[Spanish Philology]] as [[Hispanic Philology]], of extraordinary American expansion, and its multiple subfields, extremely since the Ibernative [Sephardic] or Asian [Philipinism] and even an originally non-Romanesque Iberian peninsular domain such as vascuence, in addition to its peninsular Romanesque variants such as Galician, Valencian and Catalan.

11. 
The Western [[History of Law]] is based on [[Roman law].] [[Comparative Law]] defines a methodology, and is substantial especially to a field such as constitutionalism. 

12. 
The great disciplinary series in force consists of [[civil law]], [[criminal law]], [[political law]], [[constitutional law]], [[commercial law]], [[tax law]], [[labour law]], [[administrative law]], [[Law International]]. 

13. 


There are distinctions not properly disciplinary but sectoral, either inherent, such as [[Legal Ethics]], or applied, such as [[environmental law]], [[Registration Law]], [[Consumer Law]], [[Computer Law]]. 

14. 
Certainly, much of all these disciplines have profound development in the fields corresponding to different religions, although it is in the so-called "religions of the book", especially in the Christian one, where they enjoy greater specificity. 

15. 


The modernly called Human Sciences constitute an entity founded in classical antiquity, later humanistically delimited, after the medieval regime of [[Liberal Arts', The Seven Arts: Trivium et Quadrivium'' Trivium et Quadrivium'']], by the secular designation of ''''Studia humanitatis'''''' (i.e., characteristically and centrally [[Grammar]], [[Rhetoric]], [[Dialéctica]], [[Pomatic]], Poetry or Literature as discipline and reading of the classical canon, [[History]], [[Philosophy]], <ref>Cf. 

16. 
Moreover, these disciplinary fields, as autonomous as they are symmetrically interrelated, are joined by other true fields of a first-class transversal methodological nature, so for example and eminently the [[Ecdotic]] or Textual Criticism, the [[Translation]], [[Dialectology]], [[Comparative Literature]], comparative Linguistics and, even beyond, in its full multidisciplinary and globalizing sense, the [Comparison]], which ultimately concerns the whole of the sciences, especially human, but also social and natural. 

17. 

"Aesthetics"

Aesthetics refers both to Nature, and to life in general, and to art as a Philosophy of Art in Hegelian concept. 

18. 

- Studies of Visual or Plastic Arts

The traditionally called [[Beautiful Arts]] have been plastic ones, i.e. 

19. 
The [art critic] analyses, observes and appreciates [works of art] from a perspective whose degree of [objectivity] is one of the basic problems of these specializations, particularly in the media of a publicity or current nature. 

20. 
Likewise, the [[Numismatic], and the "minor" arts series, be it [ceramic] and decorative arts, or [caligraphy]. 

21. 
However, [[Gnoseology], on the one hand, and [[Epistemology]], which, however, can now be sectorally attached to each of the humanistic disciplines per se, can be said to continue to point out the different and respective limits of cognitive activity and disciplinary. 

22. 
These fields and objects, definably, refer to visual, visual and musical listening arts. 

23. 
Modernly, especially from the end of the eighteenth century and the sensist and empirical philosophy, in particular the work of [[Antonio Eximeno], music abandons the physical-mathematical doctrine to begin to definitively institute an expressive concept, which is the one that will triumph in musical practice and corresponding aesthetic thinking in the nineteenth century, bearing fruit the "national" music. 

24. 

Musicology

It is generally called Musicology, in parallel with Philology and the series dedicated to the Plastic Arts, to the triple disciplinary distinction of [[Music History]], [Music Theory]] and Music Criticism.

Dilthey says: "Understanding falls under the general concept of knowing, by being enchanted by ''knowing'', in the broadest sense, that process in which a knowledge of universal validity is sought." "We call the process of knowing psychic life from its sensitively given manifestations." "We call ''interpretation'' the technical understanding of written manifestations of life". 

27. 
Education is often referred to in its aspects of Philosophy, Economics, etc., but preferably discriminates against two well-established fields: Education Policy and [[Comparative Education]]. 

28. 
Hermeneutics, this is the theory of interpretation and the pursuit of meaning, it refers eminently to the texts, in preference to important and difficult texts, which is why it is linked from its origin to [[Philology]] and [Literary Criticism]] as well as to [[Philosophy]] and also exists and has existed secularly its specialization also as [[Escritution]] relating to sacred texts.

"Extract" Psychology

Anthropology

There is fundamentally a [[Philosophical Anthropology]] and an Ethnographic Anthropology or [Ethnography]]. 

31. 
Both domains have become, each, for its part, a tripartite disciplinary body organized on the basis of three criteria: historical, theoretical and application whose disposition as a real science consists of the subsequent double series of [[Historical Linguistics]], [[General Linguistics]] or theoretical-descriptive and [[Applied Linguistics]], and on the other hand [[History of Literature]], [[Literary Theory]], [Literary History]]. 

32. 

History or Historiography

It is to be understood, first of all, following the Hegelian classification, from an immediate history that conceptualizes what has happened and has been seen, a mused story and a story by concepts. 

33. 


Much smaller entity have acquired the delimitations of "History of Mindsets" and "Intellectual History", of less sharp or less effective profiles. 

34. 

History of Culture and History of Ideas

The [[History of Culture]] and the [[History of Ideas]] form two modern and special historiographic branches by virtue of the complex historicality of their objects. 

35. 


[[Wilhelm Dilthey" Dilthey]], heir to Friedrich Schleiermacher's hermeneutics, assumes the concept of "understanding" ('Verstehen')) as a cognitive principle of the human sciences. 

36. 
The hermeneutic method, after the ancient schools, from Alexandria to Antioch or Pergamon, he obtained a technical focus with Flacius and later with Meier, to reach in the thought of [[Friedrich Schleiermacher] his peak as a total method aimed at "understanding", that is to say relative to logic and grammar as well as rhetoric and dialectics and history, Dilthey explained. 

37. 


From its platonic foundation, and behind the Socratic axis, which decided a philosophy of man in the face of a philosophy of nature, it is worth noting the secular existence of a double standard, that of a contemplative philosophy, sometimes neoplatonic, and a philosophy sectorally disciplinary and more characteristically Aristotelian and academic. 

38. 

There are established a number of special branches, as well [[Philosophy of Language]], [[Philosophy of History]], [Philosophy of Science]], Philosophy of Religion.] Philosophy, Philosophy of Education. 

39. 
The approach of this discipline has traditionally been applied to the study of the evolution and behavior of paradigmatic aspects of the individual, either of [[social group-human groups], whether graphers (without writing) or isolated, but also in coexistence with other lines of study relating to modern life and societies and their derivations (especially Western ones); for example, the applications related to anthropology of the company, already after the object relationship established between rural and urban anthropology, among others. 

40. 

Theology and Science of Religions

The general term of Ecclesiastical Sciences (still in force at the end of the 18th in the work of [[John Andrew]] ) was deprecated, encompassing [[Theology]], [[canonical law]], [[Ecclesiastical Law],[[Church History]] and [[SchoolIng]] remaining from them the fundamental and distinctive marbel of Theology, currently [[Science of Religions]] currently the subsequent term of greater effect and that therefore, or at least in part, must encompass the remaining minor designations in live use, starting with [[Science of Religions]] currently the subsequent term of greater effect and that therefore, or at least in part, must encompass the remaining minor designations in live use, starting with [[Science of Religions]] currently the subsequent term of greater effect and that, therefore, or at least in part, must encompass the remaining minor designations in live use, starting with [[Science of Religions]] currently the subsequent term of greater effect and that, therefore, or at least in part, it must encompass the remaining minor designations in live use, starting with [[Science of Religions]] currently the subsequent term of greater effect and that, therefore, or at least in part, it must encompass the remaining minor designations in live use, starting with [[Science of Religions]] currently the subsequent term of greater validity and that, therefore, or at least in part, must encompass the remaining minor designations in live use, starting with [[Science Comparative Religions]]. 

41. 

"Art Sciences"

The [Art Sciences]] form a series analogous to the general of Philology, following the three criteria of historical, theoretical and application intervention, this is History or Historiography of Art, Theory of Art and Artistic Criticism. 

42. 
In ''The Historical World'', which offers the antonomasia of the science of the spirit as humanistic, Dilthey says of "the methods in which the spiritual world is presented to us": "The connection of the sciences of the spirit is determined by its foundation in experience and understanding, and in both we find stark differences with regard to the sciences of nature, which lend their own character to the building of the spirit". 

43. 

Education or Education Sciences

The general term [[Education Sciences]] or Education, which would generally define the object, to include, above all, [[Pedagogy]] and [[Didactic]], the two traditionally defined branches of this field, has been established. 

44. 

"Legal Sciences"

Legal Sciences or [[Law Sciences]] is the marbete that encompasses the different disciplinary fields established in the legal field, from the hybrid [[Philosophy of Law]], in turn linked to moral and political philosophy, to [[Jurisprudence]] by its particularized end, which reaches the documentary and taxonomy of the great repertoires, whether active or merely historical. 

45. 

Geography

Geography constitutes the plural and paradigmatic scientific series that concerns, according to its parts, both the human sciences, so traditionally called [[Human Geography], bordering history and anthropology, as well as physical-natural ones, this is the [[ Physical geography]], and also social in the case of [[Geography of Population]]. 

46. 

Quantitative and statistical methods, although they may play some role in scientific and humanistic research, according to sound logic can be understood, in no case are they capable of playing any decisive or constant role in human sciences, unlike the social sciences, in which they often perform a characteristic or essential procedure. 

47. 
The growth of social sciences, especially thanks to the vast aporganizational political atteitation of Western societies, especially as an application of the "survey" and statistical procedure, has led to an academic withdrawal from the Human Sciences and humanistic culture, which are to relocate their programme and unmissable purposes in a world governed, for better and for worse, by the [[public space]]. 

48. 

General Philology

The general scope of Philology is organized on the dichotomy of two major domains: Science of Language or [[Linguistics]] and its parallel [[Science of Literature]] or literary.

[[File:Dilthey1-4.jpg-right-thumb-130 px Wilhelm Dilthey (1910)]

In the ''Introduction to the Sciences of the Spirit',' Dilthey states that the study of the human sciences or "sciences of the spirit" is the interpretation of personal experience in a reflective understanding of experience and a natural expression of gestures, words and art.
