Partly because of the interest of [[Mao Zedong]], historians in the 1950s took a special interest in the role of [[list of rebellions in China|peasant rebellions]] in Chinese history and compiled documentary histories to examine them.<ref>James P

The first systematic Chinese historical text, the [[Records of the Grand Historian|''Shiji'' (''Records of the Grand Historian'', 史記)]], was written by [[Sima Qian]] (c.{{nbsp}}145 or 135–86{{nbsp}}BC) based on work by his father, [[Sima Tan]]

Such a view is heavily influenced by modernization theory but, in China's case, it is also strongly influenced by indigenous sources such as the notion of ''Shijie Datong'' or "Great Unity"

[[Naito Konan]] developed the influential thesis that China developed an early modern society from the 8th to the 12th century

As only a centralized administration could organize the building and maintenance of large-scale systems of irrigation, the need for such systems made [[bureaucratic despotism]] inevitable in Oriental lands.<ref name="Andreski1985">{{cite book|author=Stanislav Andreski|title=The Use of Comparative Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7eW0hwZ3eZMC&pg=PA165|accessdate=16 September 2013|year=1985|publisher=University of California Press|page=165|id=GGKEY:Y0TY2LKP809}}</ref>

When Wittfogel published his ''[[Oriental Despotism: A Comparative Study of Total Power]]'', critics pointed out that water management was given the high status China accorded to officials concerned with taxes, rituals, or fighting off bandits

 Scholars are using previously overlooked documentary evidence, such as masses of government and family archives, and economic records such as census tax rolls, price records, and land surveys
0.0402676
Such a narrative was employed after the fall of the empire, by those compiling the history of the Qing and by those who justified the attempted restorations of the imperial system by [[Yuan Shikai]] and [[Zhang Xun (Qing loyalist)|Zhang Xun]]
0.0455576
The Yuan and Qing Dynasties, which might be thought foreign, faithfully carried out this practice, writing the official Chinese-language histories of the Han-ruled Song and Ming Dynasties, respectively

 While the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] and earlier dynasties may be labeled as [[feudalism|feudal]], later dynasties were much more centralized than how Marx analyzed their European counterparts as being

Similarly, regardless of the particular merits of individual emperors, founders would be portrayed in more laudatory terms, and the last ruler of a dynasty would always be castigated as depraved and unworthy, even when that was not the case
0.056947
This notion has also been subject to the criticism that to say "China has not changed fundamentally" is [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]], since it requires that one look for things that have not changed and then arbitrarily define those as fundamental

 A new concept, popularized by [[John Fairbank]], was the notion of "change within tradition", which argued that China did change in the pre-modern period but that this change existed within certain cultural traditions

The Marxist view saw the events of 1911 as a [[Marxism#Revolution, socialism, and communism|Bourgeois Revolution]].<ref>Winston Hsieh, ''Chinese Historiography on the Revolution of 1911 : A Critical Survey and a Selected Bibliography'' (Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, 1975)</ref> In the 1920s, the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Party]] issued a theory of three political stages based on [[Sun Yatsen]]'s writings:
* Military unification – 1923 to 1928 ([[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]])
* Political tutelage – 1928 to 1947
* [[Constitution of the Republic of China|Constitutional democracy]] – 1947 onward

The most obvious criticism is the near-identical nature of "political tutelage" and of a "constitutional democracy" consisting only of the one-party rule until the 1990s
0.11056
 However, this political restriction is less confining than it may first appear in that the Marxist historical framework is surprisingly flexible, and it is a rather simple matter to modify an alternative historical theory to use language that at least does not challenge the Marxist interpretation of history.<ref>Albert Feuerwerker, "China's History in Marxian Dress," ''The American Historical Review'' 66.2  (1961): 323–353

===Convergence===
Convergence theory, including [[Hu Shih]] and [[Ray Huang]]'s involution theory, holds that the past 150 years have been a period in which Chinese and Western civilization have been in the process of converging into a world civilization

This led to the creation of the [[New History of the Five Dynasties|''Xin Wudai Shi (New History of the Five Dynasties'', 新五代史)]], which covered five dynasties in over 70 chapters.<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11380/ |title=History of the Five Dynasties |website=[[World Digital Library]] |date=1280–1368 |accessdate=2013-09-04}}</ref>

Toward the end of the [[Qing dynasty]] in the early 20th century, scholars looked to Japan and the West for models

Postmodern scholarship largely rejects grand narratives altogether, preferring to publish empirical studies on the socioeconomics, and political or cultural dynamics, of smaller communities within China.<ref>Charles Horner, ''Rising China and Its Postmodern Fate: Memories of Empire in a New Global Context'' (2009) [https://www.amazon.com/Rising-China-Postmodern-Fate-International/dp/0820333344/ excerpt]</ref>

===Nationalism===
In China historical scholarship remains largely [[Chinese nationalism|nationalist]] and modernist or even traditionalist

Against this, [[Chen Shui-bian]] proposed his own [[Four-Stage Theory of the Republic of China|four-stage theory]]

In the 1980s, [[Paul Cohen (historian)|Paul Cohen]], a student of Fairbank's, issued a call for a more "China-Centered history of China".<ref>Paul Cohen, ''Discovering History in China: American Historical Writing on the Recent Chinese Past'' (New York, London:: Columbia University Press,  1984), Ch 1 "The Problem with 'China's Response to the West,'pp

* Slave society – [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] to [[Shang dynasty|Shang]]
* Feudal society (decentralized) – [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] to [[Sui dynasty|Sui]]
* Feudal society (bureaucratic) – [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] to the [[First Opium War]]
* Feudal society (semi-colonial) – First Opium War to end of [[Qing dynasty]]
* Capitalist society – [[History of the Republic of China|Republican era]]
* Socialist society – [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] 1949 to present

Because of the strength of the [[Communist Party of China]] and the importance of the Marxist interpretation of history in legitimizing its rule, it was for many years difficult for historians within the PRC to actively argue in favor of non-Marxist and anti-Marxist interpretations of history

==Key organizing concepts==

===Dynastic cycle===
Like the [[Three-age system#The Metallic Ages of Hesiod|three ages]] of the Greek poet [[Hesiod]], the oldest Chinese historiography viewed mankind as living in a fallen age of depravity, cut off from the virtues of the past, as [[Confucius]] and his disciples revered the [[sage king]]s [[Emperor Yao]] and [[Emperor Shun]]
0.233755
This expanded view encompassed internal and external tributary lands and [[conquest dynasties]] in the history of a China seen as a coherent multi-ethnic nation from time immemorial, incorporating the contributions of non-Han to Chinese history, including dynasties once considered foreign, such as the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] and the Manchu [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], as well as the Khitan [[Liao dynasty|Liao]] and Jurchen [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] dynasties
0.252977

===Modernization===
This view of Chinese history sees Chinese society as a traditional society needing to become modern, usually with the implicit assumption of Western society as the model.<ref>A prominent example is Gilbert Rozman, ed., ''The Modernization of China'' (New York: Free Press; London: Collier Macmillan, 1981), in which a series of essays analyzes "The Legacy of the Past" and "The Transformation."</ref> Such a view was common among British and French scholars during the 19th and early 20th centuries but is now typically dismissed as [[eurocentrism]], since such a view permits an implicit justification for breaking the society from its static past and bringing it into the modern world under European direction.<ref>Ch

One held that China followed the set European pattern which Marxists thought to be universal; that is, from ancient slavery to medieval feudalism to modern capitalism; while another group argued that "Chinese society was extraordinarily saturated with stagnancy, as compared to the West" and assumed that China existed in a "qualitatively different historical world from Western society"
0.296897
The traditionalist school of scholarship resorts to official imperial records and colloquial historical works, and analyzes the rise and fall of different dynasties using Confucian philosophy, albeit modified by an institutional administration perspective<ref>

Florian Schneider argues that, nationalism in China is largely a product of the digital revolution, in which a very large fraction of the population participates as readers and commentators And relators of ideas to their friends.<ref>Florian Schneider, "Mediated Massacre: Digital Nationalism and History Discourse on China's Web."

The Marxist view of history is that history is governed by universal laws and that according to these laws, a society moves through a series of stages, with the transition between stages being driven by class struggle.<ref>Arif Dirlik, "The Universalization of a Concept: From 'Feudalism' to Feudalism in Chinese Marxist Historiography," ''Journal of Peasant Studies'' 12.2–3 (January/April 1985): 197–227.</ref> These stages are:
* Slave society
* Feudal society
* Capitalist society
* Socialist society
* The world communist society

The official historical view within the People's Republic of China associates each of these stages with a particular era in Chinese history
