In the second half of the 19th century, [[Heinrich Julius Adolph Robert Hartig] Robert Hartig] greatly promoted research into dendronchrology in Europe, thanks to a clear conception of the development of the rings through a detailed study of the effects of [ice-cold]s and activity damage of [Insects]]

Proxy – remote sensing – NDVI
In recent years, in addition, dendronchrology has been used as a valuable "proxy (climate)-proxy]" for the reconstruction of variations in [[biomass] and primary productivity, in a study framework on [global climate change]] and/or on variations in the last [decades] of vegetation status

He thought sunspot activity could influence the climate on Earth, and was looking for the relationship between the cyclic activity of [[sunspots]] and the behavior of rainfall

In [[1827], [[:en:Alexander Catlin Twining' Alexander Catlin Twining] rediscovered this phenomenon

Woody shrub species are of interest in more arid or tree-scarce areas; progress in this regard is also necessary because of the small importance that has been given to these species

The rings better reflect their history and that of their atmosphere in the growing season, therefore the information of what happened during the cold season is less reliable

In Europe, he was the botanist [[Bruno Huber) Bruno Huber]] who began to develop this discipline during the first half of the twentieth century, but it was more than 30 years after the founding of the first laboratory for similar institutes to be established in the rest of the world

Climate Reconstruction

Thanks to dendronchrology it has been possible to reconstruct climatic variations over the last centuries, a very valuable tool especially in South America where, due to structural problems, climate records do not cover the entire territory and do not cover great temporal extension

Thanks to the use of green indices such as NDVI ([normalized difference vegetation index]]), the relationships found between growth and climate as well as productivity and climate have allowedor reconstruct into the past the variations of the NDVI, which can be measured only by the last two or three decades by virtue of the availability of [[satellite imagery]] relating to the same period

The Chronologies of thousands of years
The advancement in the knowledge of the technique and the existence of some very long-lived species have allowed to develop extensive chronologies from the growth rings

Fritts is a classic in the study of dendrochronology applied to climate reconstructions; one of his greatest contributions is the book ''Tree Rings and Climate''

Challenges
One of the limitations of this technique is to find species that form rings with annual resolution, where it is possible to distinguish the annual rings and thus be able to date the samples correctly and build chronologies

In the [[15th century], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] recognized the relationship between rings and atmospheric precipitation in the vegetative period: "The rings on the trunks of cut trees show the years and, according to their thickness, years or less dry..."

The ''dendrocronology'' (from [classic Greek') tree, "jronos", time, and "logos", study) is the science that deals with the [[data] of [[ring]]s of [[development (biology)'] of the [[plant]]s [[tree tree]] and [[bush-arbustive][[[woody].] [[woody'] [[kitchen].] [[woody]

The use of growth rings to date climate phenomena began in France in [[1737], with [[Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau]] and [[Georges Louis Leclerc, Count of Buffon]], and in [[1745], in [Sweden], with [[Carlos Levenous]], who counting the rings into the past dated a strong frost that occurred in 1708-1709, using only one specimen

The samples, in a second moment, are placed in a sample holder with the rings perpendicular to the support plane and then sanded, so that the rings can be evident

In order to verify the accuracy of the reading and to relieve the presence of anomalies [[xilology-xylological], such as missing rings or false rings, elementary chronologies are confronted through visual and statistical synchronization processes: this is what is done is called "cofechado", a basic principle of dendrochronology and a technique that ensures that each ring has been given the exact date of its formation
