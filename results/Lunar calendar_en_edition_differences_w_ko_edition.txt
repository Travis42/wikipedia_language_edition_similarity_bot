== Lunisolar calendars ==
{{main|Lunisolar calendar}}
Most calendars referred to as "lunar" calendars are in fact [[lunisolar calendar]]s. 

2. 
A 49-month cycle was proposed as the basis of an alternative [[Computus|Easter computation]] by [[Isaac Newton]] around 1700.<ref>[http://www.cs.biu.ac.il/~belenka/Newton-calendar.pdf Reform of the Julian Calendar as Envisioned by Isaac Newton] by Ari Belenkiy and Eduardo Vila Echagüe (pdf); Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London (vol.&nbsp;59, no.&nbsp;3, pp.&nbsp;223–254).</ref> The [[tabular Islamic calendar]]'s 360-month cycle is equivalent to 24×15&nbsp;months, minus a correction of one day. 

3. 
In some lunisolar calendars, such as the [[Chinese calendar]], the first day of a month is the day when an astronomical [[new moon]] occurs in a particular time zone. 

4. 

[[Synodic month]]s are 29 or 30&nbsp;days in length, making a [[lunar year]] of 12 months about 11 days shorter than a [[solar year]]. 

5. 
Present-day lunisolar calendars include the [[Chinese calendar|Chinese]], [[Hindu calendar|Hindu]], and [[Thai lunar calendar|Thai]] calendars. 

6. 
Some lunar calendars do not use intercalation, such as most [[Islamic calendar]]s. 

7. 
In others, such as some [[Hindu calendar]]s, each month begins on the day after the full moon or the new moon. 

8. 
Since the period of 12 such lunations, a '''lunar year''', is only 354&nbsp;days, 8&nbsp;hours, 48&nbsp;minutes, 34&nbsp;seconds ({{val|354.367056}}&nbsp;days), purely lunar calendars lose around 11&nbsp;days per year relative to the [[Gregorian calendar]].

== Length of the lunar month ==
The length of each lunar cycle varies slightly from the average value.
