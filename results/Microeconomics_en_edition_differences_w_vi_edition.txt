It is also possible to more fully understand the impacts – both positive and negative – of agents seeking out or acquiring information.<ref name="Varian H.R. 

3. 

[[Market equilibrium]] occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, the intersection of the supply and demand curves in the figure above. 

4. 
At a price below equilibrium, there is a shortage of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. 

5. 
At a price above equilibrium, there is a surplus of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded.

Imperfect competition is a type of market structure showing some but not all features of competitive markets.

Monopolistic competition is a situation in which many firms with slightly different products compete.

Economists call the solution to the utility maximization problem a [[Marshallian demand function|Walrasian demand function]] or correspondence. 

9. 

[[File:Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg|thumb|The [[supply and demand]] model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability and demand. 

10. 
Other factors can change demand; for example an increase in income will shift the demand curve for a [[normal good]] outward relative to the origin, as in the figure.

That is, the utility maximization problem is used by economists to not only explain ''what'' or ''how'' individuals make choices but ''why'' individuals make choices as well.

=== Supply and demand ===
{{main|Supply and demand}}

Supply and demand is an [[economic model]] of [[price determination]] in a perfectly competitive [[Market (economics)|market]]. 

17. 
The graph depicts a right-shift in demand from D<sub>1</sub> to D<sub>2</sub> along with the consequent increase in price and quantity required to reach a new market-clearing equilibrium point on the supply curve (S).]]
The theory of [[supply and demand]] usually assumes that markets are [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive]]. 

18. 
These distinctions translate to differences in the [[Price elasticity of supply|elasticity]] (responsiveness) of the supply curve in the short and long runs and corresponding differences in the price-quantity change from a shift on the supply or demand side of the market. 

19. 

=== Perfect competition ===
{{main|Perfect competition}}

Perfect competition is a situation in which numerous small firms producing identical products compete against each other in a given industry.

21. 
The [[Model (economics)|model]] of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves, price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded.

A good example would be that of digital marketplaces, such as [[eBay]], on which many different sellers sell similar products to many different buyers. 

24. 
The "Law of Supply" states that, in general, a rise in price leads to an expansion in supply and a fall in price leads to a contraction in supply.

Opportunity cost is closely related to the idea of time constraints.

[[Image:Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg|thumb|The [[supply and demand]] model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability at each price (supply) and the desires of those with purchasing power at each price (demand). 

28. 

In the mathematical model for the cost of production, the short-run total cost is equal to [[fixed cost]] plus total [[variable cost]].

The fixed cost refers to the cost that is incurred regardless of how much the firm produces.

34. 
It concludes that in a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive market]] with no [[externality|externalities]], [[excise|per unit taxes]], or [[price controls]], the [[unit price]] for a particular [[Good (economics)|good]] is the price at which the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers. 

35. 

''Supply'' is the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price. 

36. 
Firms in perfect competition are "price takers" (they do not have enough [[market power]] to profitably increase the price of their goods or services). 

37. 
In a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive market]], supply and demand equate marginal cost and marginal utility at equilibrium.<ref name="Hicks">{{cite book |title=Value and Capital: An Inquiry into Some Fundamental Principles of Economic Theory |last=Hicks |first=J.R. 

38. 
Analogously, the producer compares [[marginal revenue]] (identical to price for the perfect competitor) against the [[marginal cost]] of a good, with ''marginal profit'' the difference.

=== Consumer demand theory ===

Consumer demand theory relates [[Preference (economics)|preferences]] for the consumption of both [[good (economics)|goods]] and services to the consumption expenditures; ultimately, this relationship between preferences and consumption expenditures is used to relate preferences to [[supply and demand|consumer demand curves]].

{{main|Cost-of-production theory of value}}

The cost-of-production theory of value states that the price of an object or condition is determined by the sum of the cost of the resources that went into making it.

Production theory is the study of production, or the economic process of converting inputs into outputs.<ref>[https://assets.cambridge.org/97811070/36161/frontmatter/9781107036161_frontmatter.pdf  Sickles, R., & Zelenyuk, V.

Consumers in a perfect competitive market have perfect knowledge about the products that are being sold in this market.
