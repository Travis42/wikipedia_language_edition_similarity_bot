The fundamental principle of helping people strengthen memory is to encrypt hard-to-remember subjects (e.g., phone numbers, people's names, math formulas) into memorable subjects for the human brain (e.g.

Whenever we need to remember Albert Eistein's date of birth, we just remember this story and decode the number of his birth date. 

7. 

For example, to remember Albert Einstein's birth date is 14-3-1879, use the code to the following text

0 =

1 = M (for 1 write as "' ' ' M")

3 = B (for 3 write as "' ' ' B ' ' ' A")

4 = F, P, Ph (as 4 in English is "' ' ' F ' ' ' Our")

5 =

6 =

7 = V, R (as player "' ' R ' ' ' Onaldo" carries the number "7" in competition)

8 = T, Th, Tr (as 8 writes "' 't '")

9 = C, Ch (because 9 writes "' ' ' ' HÃ­n")

14. 
The transfer of information to the long-term memory area to remember longer can be triggered and improved by repeating that information, or even more efficiently, by attaching that information to a meaning or knowledge available. 

15. 
Recalling information more than once, the information becomes more and more unforgettable and the speed of forgetting will drop to the lowest level or never forget.
