How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

Archaic humans

en edition's differences with the ja version: 


1. 
Based on his analysis of the relationship between brain size and hominin group size, he concluded that because archaic humans had large brains, they must have lived in groups of over 120 individuals. 

2. 
Dunbar argues that it was not possible for hominins to live in such large groups without using language, otherwise there could be no group cohesion and the group would disintegrate. 

3. 
Since the peak of human brain size during the archaics, it has begun to decline.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Zyga|first1=Lisa|title=Cro Magnon skull shows that our brains have shrunk|url=https://phys.org/news/2010-03-cro-magnon-skull-brains-shrunk.html|accessdate=14 June 2017|work=phys.org|date=15 March 2010}}</ref>

==Terminology and definition==
{{align|right|{{Human timeline}}}}{{align|right|{{Hominins}}}}
The category archaic human lacks a single, agreed upon definition.<ref name="dawkins"/> According to one definition, ''Homo sapiens'' is a single species comprising several subspecies that include the archaics and modern humans. 

5. 
Other taxonomists prefer not to consider archaics and modern humans as a single species but as several different species. 

6. 

Archaic humans had a brain size averaging 1,200 to 1,400 cubic centimeters, which overlaps with the range of modern humans.

==Brain size expansion==

The emergence of archaic humans is sometimes used as an example of [[punctuated equilibrium]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67NUz_HVJfQC&printsec=frontcover#PPA62,M1|title=Alone in the World?|first1=Van|last1=Huyssteen|first2=Wentzel Van|last2=Huyssteen|date=12 April 2006|publisher=Wm. 

8. 
Non-modern varieties of ''Homo'' are certain to have survived until after 30,000 years ago, and perhaps until as recently as 12,000 years ago.
