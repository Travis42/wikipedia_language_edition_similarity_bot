For some environmental historians "the general conditions of the environment, the scale and arrangement of land and sea, the availability of resources, and the presence or absence of animals available for domestication, and associated organisms and disease vectors, that makes the development of human cultures possible and even predispose the direction of their development"<ref>{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=5}}</ref> and that "history is inevitably guided by forces that are not of human origin or subject to human choice".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=97}}</ref> This approach has been attributed to American environmental historians Webb and Turner<ref>{{Harvnb|White|2001|p=55}}</ref> and, more recently to [[Jared Diamond]] in his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'', where the presence or absence of disease vectors and resources such as plants and animals that are amenable to domestication that may not only stimulate the development of human culture but even determine, to some extent, the direction of that development

This was in large part a reaction to the way nature was represented in history at the time, which “portrayed the advance of culture and technology as releasing humans from dependence on the natural world and providing them with the means to manage it [and] celebrated human mastery over other forms of life and the natural environment, and expected technological improvement and economic growth to accelerate”.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hughes|2001|p=5}}</ref> Environmental historians intended to develop a post-colonial historiography that was "''more inclusive in its narratives''".<ref name=Worster290 />

He sees a lack of "human agency" in its texts and suggest it be written more to act: as of information for environmental scientists; incorporation of the notion of risk; a closer analysis of what it is we mean by "environment"; confronting the way environmental history is at odds with the humanities because it emphasises the division between "materialist, and cultural or constructivist explanations for human behaviour".<ref>See {{Harvnb|Warde|Sorlin|2007|pp=107–130}}</ref>

Although at all times environmental influences have extended beyond particular geographic regions and cultures, during the 20th and early 21st centuries anthropogenic environmental change has assumed global proportions, most prominently with climate change but also as a result of settlement, the spread of disease and the globalization of world trade.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=78}}</ref>
