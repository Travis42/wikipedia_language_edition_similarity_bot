In an essay first published in ''Die Zeit'' on September 26, 1986, the historian [[Jürgen Kocka]] argued against Nolte that the Holocaust was indeed a “singular” event because it had been committed by an advanced Western nation, and argued that Nolte's comparisons of the Holocaust with similar mass killings in [[Pol Pot]]'s [[Cambodia]], [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]], and [[Idi Amin]]'s [[Uganda]] were invalid because of the backward nature of those societies.<ref>Kocka, pp.

By ‘monotheism’ and ‘anti-nature’ he did not imply a political process: he related these terms to the tradition of Western philosophy and religion, and left no doubt that for him they were not only adjuncts of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s notion of liberty, but also of the [[Christian Gospel]]s and [[Parmenides]]' concept of being. 

6. 
He claimed that all three were “abnormal once”, but whereas the Soviet Union and Germany were now “normal” states, Israel was still “abnormal” and, in Nolte's view, in danger of becoming a fascist state that might commit [[genocide]] against the Palestinians.

All this does not stop Klaus Hildebrand in the ''Historische Zeitschrift'' from commending Nolte’s “pioneering essay”, because it “attempts to project exactly the seemingly unique aspects of the history of the Third Reich onto the backdrop of the European and global development".

In particular, controversy centered on an argument of Nolte's 1985 essay “Between Myth and Revisionism” from the book ''Aspects of the Third Reich'', first published in German as ''"Die negative Lebendigkeit des Dritten Reiches"'' (''"The Negative Vitality of the Third Reich"'') as an opinion piece in the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'' on 24 July 1980, but which did not attract widespread attention until 1986 when [[Jürgen Habermas]] criticized the essay in a ''feuilleton'' piece.<ref>Evans, pp.

Nonetheless, the following question must seem permissible, even unavoidable: Did the National Socialists or Hitler perhaps commit an “Asiatic” deed merely because they and their ilk considered themselves to be the potential victims of an “Asiatic” deed.

86–87</ref> The second type is "theoretical transcendence", the striving to go beyond what exists in the world towards a new future, eliminating traditional fetters imposed on the human mind by poverty, backwardness, ignorance, and class.<ref name=m86-87/> Nolte himself defined "theoretical transcendence" as such:
{{Quote |Theoretical transcendence may be taken to mean the reaching out of the mind beyond what exists and what can exist toward an absolute whole; in a broader sense this may be applied to all that goes beyond, that releases man from the confines of the everyday world, and which, as an ‘awareness of the horizon’, makes it possible for him to experience the world as a whole.<ref>Nolte, p.

===''Der europäische Bürgerkrieg''===
Another area of controversy was Nolte's 1987 book ''Der europäische Bürgerkrieg'' (''The European Civil War'') and some accompanying statements, by which Nolte appeared to flirt with [[Holocaust denial]] as a serious historical argument.<ref name="ev83">Evans, p. 

38.

40. 
18</ref> Nolte complained that excessive present-day interest in the Nazi period had the effect of drawing "attention away from the pressing questions of the present—for example, the question of "unborn life" or the presence of genocide [[Vietnam War|yesterday in Vietnam]] and [[Soviet–Afghan War|today in Afghanistan]]".<ref name=n18/>

The crux of Nolte's thesis was presented when he wrote:

<blockquote>"It is a notable shortcoming of the literature about National Socialism that it does not know or does not want to admit to what degree all the deeds—with the sole exception of the technical process of gassing—that the National Socialists later committed had already been described in a voluminous literature of the early 1920s: mass deportations and shootings, torture, death camps, extermination of entire groups using strictly objective selection criteria, and public demands for the annihilation of millions of guiltless people who were thought to be "enemies".

Some historians such as [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] were most forceful in arguing that the sufferings of the “[[kulak]]s” deported during the Soviet “[[dekulakization]]” campaign of the early 1930s were in no way analogous to the suffering of the Jews deported in the early 1940s.

The political scientist Kurt Sontheimer, in an essay first published in the ''Rheinischer Merkur'' newspaper on November 21, 1986, accused Nolte and his supporters of attempting to create a new “national consciousness” intended to sever the Federal Republic's “intellectual and spiritual ties with the West”.<ref>Sontheimer in Knowlton, (1993) p.

85–86</ref>

Nolte argued that fascism functioned at three levels, namely in the world of politics as a form of opposition to [[Marxism]], at the sociological level in opposition to bourgeois values, and in the "metapolitical" world as "resistance to transcendence" ("transcendence" in [[German language|German]] can be translated as the "spirit of modernity").<ref>Griffin, pp. 

48. 

The books ''Der Faschismus in seiner Epoche'', ''Deutschland und der kalte Krieg'', and ''Marxismus und industrielle Revolution'' (''Marxism and the Industrial Revolution'') formed a trilogy in which Nolte seeks to explain what he considered to be the most important developments of the 20th century.

===Habermas' attack===
The philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] in an article in the ''[[Die Zeit]]'' of 11 July 1986 strongly criticized Nolte, along with [[Andreas Hillgruber]] and [[Michael Stürmer]], for engaging in what Habermas called “apologetic” history writing in regards to the Nazi era, and for seeking to “close Germany’s opening to the West” that in Habermas's view has existed since 1945.<ref>Habermas

53. 
94</ref> Schulze argued that Habermas's attack on Nolte was flawed because he failed to provide any proof that the Holocaust was unique, and argued there were many "aspects" of the Holocaust that were "common" to other historical events.<ref name=s94/>

In an essay first published in the ''Frankfurter Rundschau'' newspaper on November 14, 1986, [[Heinrich August Winkler]] wrote of Nolte's essay "The Past That Will Not Pass":

<blockquote>“Those who read the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine'' all the way through to the culture section were able to read something under the title “The Past That Will Not Pass” that no German historian to date had noticed: that Auschwitz was only a copy of a Russian original – the Stalinist Gulag Archipelago. 

54. 
80–81.</ref> Some of the examples Nolte cited were the Armenian genocide; Soviet [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportations]] of the so-called “traitor nations,” such as the [[Crimean Tatars]] and the [[Volga Germans]]; British “area bombing” in World War II; and American violence in the Vietnam War.<ref name="Evans, Richard p. 

55. 
Nolte's critics have acknowledged these statements, but claim that Nolte's arguments can be construed as being sympathetic to the Nazis, such as his defence of the [[Commissar Order]] as a legitimate military order, his argument that the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' massacres of Soviet Jews were a reasonable "preventative security" response to [[Soviet partisans|partisan]] attacks, his statements citing [[Viktor Suvorov]] that [[Operation Barbarossa]] was a "preventive war" forced on Hitler allegedly by an impending Soviet attack, his claim that too much scholarship on the Holocaust has been the work of "biased" Jewish historians, or his use of Nazi-era language such as his practice of referring to [[Red Army]] soldiers in [[World War II]] as “Asiatic hordes”.<ref>Evans, pp.

The German historian [[Horst Möller]], in an essay first published in late 1986 in the ''Beiträge zur Konfliktforschung'' magazine, argued that Nolte was not attempting to "excuse" Nazi crimes by comparing them with the crimes of others, but was instead trying to explain Nazi war-crimes.<ref name="mo218">Möller in Knowlton, (1993) p.

Nolte, for his part, started to write a series of letters to newspapers such as ''[[Die Zeit]]'' and ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' attacking his critics; for example, in a letter to ''Die Zeit'' on 1 August 1986, Nolte complained that his critic [[Jürgen Habermas]] was attempting to censor him for expressing his views, and accused Habermas of being the person responsible for blocking him from attending the Römerberg Conversations.<ref>Nolte in Knowlton, (1993) pp.

Nolte has little regard for specific historical context in his treatment of the history of ideas, opting to seek what [[Carl Schmitt]] labeled the abstract "final" or "ultimate" ends of ideas, which for Nolte are the most extreme conclusions which can be drawn from an idea, representing the ''ultima terminus'' of the "metapolitical".<ref name=b8/> For Nolte, ideas have a force of their own, and once a new idea has been introduced into the world, except for the total destruction of society, it cannot be ignored any more than the discovery of how to make fire or the invention of nuclear weapons can be ignored.<ref name="b9">Baldwin in Baldwin (1990) p.

Kershaw has argued that Nolte was operating on the borderlines of Holocaust denial with his implied claim that the "negative myth" of the Third Reich was created by Jewish historians, his allegations of the domination of Holocaust scholarship by Jewish historians, and his statements that one should withhold judgment on Holocaust deniers, who Nolte insists are not exclusively Germans or fascists.

In August 2000, Nolte wrote a favorable review in the ''Die Woche'' newspaper of [[Norman Finkelstein]]’s book ''[[The Holocaust Industry]]'', claiming Finkelstein’s book buttressed his claim that the memory of the Holocaust had been used by Jewish groups for their own reasons.

''The Three Faces of Fascism'' has been much praised{{citation needed|reason=By whom?|date=August 2016}} as a seminal contribution to the creation of a theory of generic fascism based on a history of ideas, as opposed to the previous class-based analyses (especially the "Rage of the Lower Middle Class" thesis) that had characterized both Marxist and liberal interpretations of fascism.<ref name= gr48/> The German historian Jen-Werner Müller wrote that Nolte "almost single-handedly" brought down the totalitarianism paradigm in the 1960s and replaced it with the fascism paradigm.<ref>Müller, Jen-Werner ''Another Country'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000 p.
