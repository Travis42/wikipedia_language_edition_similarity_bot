How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.

Normal low cost consumer grade receivers solely rely on the amplitude-modulated time signals and use narrow band receivers (with 10&nbsp;Hz bandwidth) with small ferrite [[Loop antenna#AM broadcast receiver loop antennas|loopstick antennas]] and circuits with non optimal digital signal processing delay and can therefore only be expected to determine the beginning of a second with a practical accuracy uncertainty of ± 0.1 second.

In August 2016 the French LNE-SYRTE in Paris and German PTB in Braunschweig reported the comparison and agreement of two fully independent experimental strontium lattice optical clocks in Paris and Braunschweig at an uncertainty of {{nowrap|5 × 10<sup>−17</sup>}} via a newly established phase-coherent frequency link connecting Paris and Braunschweig, using {{convert|1415|km|mi|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} of telecom fibre-optic cable.

 In a [[hydrogen maser]] clock the gas emits [[microwaves]] (the gas ''[[maser|mases]]'') on a hyperfine transition, the field in the cavity oscillates, and the cavity is tuned for maximum microwave amplitude.

==Applications==
The development of atomic clocks has led to many scientific and technological advances such as a system of precise global and regional [[satellite navigation|navigation satellite systems]], and applications in the [[Internet]], which depend critically on frequency and time standards. 

33. 
Modern rubidium standard tubes last more than ten years, and can cost as little as US$50.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Caesium reference tubes suitable for national standards currently last about seven years and cost about US$35,000. 

34. 
The experimental clocks tend to continue improving, and leadership in performance has been shifted back and forth between various types of experimental clocks.

The accuracy of experimental quantum clocks has since been superseded by experimental [[Atomic clock#Optical clocks|optical lattice clocks]] based on [[Isotopes of strontium|strontium-87]] and [[ytterbium-171]]. 

36. 
This will allow their experimental optical clocks to be compared with an accuracy similar to the expected accuracies of the optical clocks themselves. 

37. 
Two optical lattice clocks containing about {{nowrap|10 000 atoms}} of [[Isotopes of strontium|strontium-87]] were able to stay in synchrony with each other at a precision of at least {{nowrap|1.5 × 10<sup>−16</sup>}}, which is as accurate as the experiment could measure.<ref>{{cite web

The adjustment tries to correct for unwanted side-effects, such as frequencies from other electron transitions, temperature changes, and the spreading in frequencies caused by [[ensemble effect]]s.{{clarify|date=May 2014}}  One way of doing this is to sweep the microwave oscillator's frequency across a narrow range to generate a modulated signal at the detector.

In 2013 optical lattice clocks (OLCs) were shown to be as good as or better than caesium fountain clocks.

According to Jun Ye "This represents a significant improvement over any previous demonstrations." Ye further commented "The most important potential of the 3D quantum gas clock is the ability to scale up the atom numbers, which will lead to a huge gain in stability." and "The ability to scale up both the atom number and coherence time will make this new-generation clock qualitatively different from the previous generation."<ref>{{cite journal
