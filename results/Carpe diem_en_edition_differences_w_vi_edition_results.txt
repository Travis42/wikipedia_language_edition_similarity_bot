===In ancient literature===
Perhaps the first written expression of the concept is the advice given by [[Siduri]] to [[Gilgamesh]], telling him to forgo his mourning and embrace life although some scholars see it as simply urging Gilgamesh to abandon his mourning, "reversing the liminal rituals of mourning and returning to the normal and normative behaviors of Mesopotamian society."<ref>{{cite book|last=Ackerman|first=Susan|title=When Heroes Love: The Ambiguity of Eros in the Stories of Gilgamesh and David|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn= 978-0231132602|pages=130–131|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ATKodvnYS4EC&pg=PA144&dq=siduri+gilgamesh&hl=en&sa=X&ei=CttvUeTZBcnfOem0geAJ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=siduri%20carpe%20diem&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Perdue|first=Leo G.|title=Scribes, Sages, and Seers: The Sage in the Eastern Mediterranean World: The Sage in the Mediterranean World|year=2009|publisher=Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht|isbn=978-3525530832|page=57|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L1Lrt1ZM2CIC&pg=PA57&dq=Siduri+%22carpe+diem%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hO9vUeWGKIzXPKPCgfgF&ved=0CD0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=Siduri%20%22carpe%20diem%22&f=false}}</ref>

==Meaning==
In [[Horace]], the phrase is part of the longer {{Lang|la|carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero}}, which is often translated as "Seize the day, put very little trust in tomorrow (the future)"
0.0237557
The ode says that the future is unforeseen and that one should not leave to chance future happenings, but rather one should do all one can today to make one's own future better

It has been argued by various authors that this interpretation is closer to Horace's original meaning <ref>[https://daily.jstor.org/how-carpe-diem-got-lost-in-translation/ How “Carpe Diem” Got Lost in Translation by Chi Luu ''JStor Daily'' 7 August 2019]</ref>

[[Social philosopher]] Roman Krznaric suggested in his book, ''Carpe Diem Regained'' (2017), that ''carpe diem'' is the answer to consumer cultures schedules, timed work days, consumer culture and planning out our actions over the course of weeks and the weekends, instead of "just do it", with thought experiments for seizing the day rather than placing into calendars.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Macdonald |first1=Fiona |title=What it really means to 'Seize the day' |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20170517-what-it-really-means-to-seize-the-day |website=bbc.com |accessdate=16 June 2019}}</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/02/reclaming-carpe-diem-how-we-really-seize-the-day Reclaiming carpe diem: How do we really seize the day
