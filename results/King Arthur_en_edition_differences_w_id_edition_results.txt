Neither the ''Historia'' nor the ''Annales'' calls him "''rex''": the former calls him instead  "''[[dux]] bellorum''" (leader of battles) and "''miles''" (soldier).<ref>''Historia Brittonum'' [[s:History of the Britons#Arthuriana|56]], [[s:History of the Britons#Wonders of Britain|73]]; ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'' [[s:Welsh Annals|516, 537]].</ref>

Historical documents for the post-Roman period are scarce, so a definitive answer to the question of Arthur's historical existence is unlikely

Although the themes, events and characters of the Arthurian legend varied widely from text to text, and there is no one canonical version, Geoffrey's version of events often served as the starting point for later stories

The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin

Arthur and his retinue appear in some of the ''[[Lais of Marie de France|Lais]]'' of [[Marie de France]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Burgess|Busby|1999}}</ref> but it was the work of another French poet, [[Chrétien de Troyes]], that had the greatest influence with regard to the development of Arthur's character and legend.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lacy|1996b}}</ref> Chrétien wrote five Arthurian romances between {{c.|lk=no|1170}} and 1190

A less obviously legendary account of Arthur appears in the ''[[Goeznovius|Legenda Sancti Goeznovii]]'', which is often claimed to date from the early 11th century (although the earliest manuscript of this text dates from the 15th century and the text is now dated to the late 12th to early 13th century).<ref>Bourgès, André-Yves, "Guillaume le Breton et l'hagiographie bretonne aux XIIe et XIIIe siècles", in: Annales de Bretagne et des pays de l'Ouest, 1995, 102–1, pp

This patronym is unattested, but the root, ''*arto-rīg'', "bear/warrior-king", is the source of the Old Irish personal name ''Artrí''.<ref name=zimmer09>{{Harvnb|Zimmer|2009}}</ref> Some scholars have suggested it is relevant to this debate that the legendary King Arthur's name only appears as ''Arthur'' or ''Arturus'' in early Latin Arthurian texts, never as ''Artōrius'' (though Classical Latin Artōrius became Arturius in some Vulgar Latin dialects)
6.20184e-09
Many elements and incidents that are now an integral part of the Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey's ''Historia'', including Arthur's father [[Uther Pendragon]], the magician [[Merlin]], Arthur's wife [[Guinevere]], the sword [[Excalibur]], Arthur's conception at [[Tintagel Castle|Tintagel]], his final battle against [[Mordred]] at [[Camlann]], and final rest in [[Avalon]]

The textual sources for Arthur are usually divided into those written before Geoffrey's ''Historia'' (known as pre-Galfridian texts, from the Latin form of Geoffrey, ''Galfridus'') and those written afterwards, which could not avoid his influence (Galfridian, or post-Galfridian, texts)

Even in these, however, Arthur's court has started to embody legendary Britain as a whole, with "Arthur's Court" sometimes substituted for "The Island of Britain" in the formula "Three XXX of the Island of Britain".<ref>{{Harvnb|Barber|1986|pp=17–18, 49}}; {{Harvnb|Bromwich|1978}}</ref> While it is not clear from the ''Historia Brittonum'' and the ''Annales Cambriae'' that Arthur was even considered a king, by the time ''Culhwch and Olwen'' and the Triads were written he had become ''Penteyrnedd yr Ynys hon'', "Chief of the Lords of this Island", the overlord of Wales, Cornwall and the North.<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|1991a|pp= 78, 81}}</ref>

It also made Mordred the result of an [[King Arthur's family|incestuous relationship]] between Arthur and his sister [[Morgause]] and established the role of [[Camelot]], first mentioned in passing in Chrétien's ''Lancelot'', as Arthur's primary court.<ref>For a study of this cycle, see {{Harvnb|Burns|1985}}.</ref> This series of texts was quickly followed by the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]] ({{c.|lk=no|1230–40}}), of which the ''Suite du Merlin'' is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest.<ref name="lacy-1992" /> As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the ''Estoire de Merlin'' and the ''Mort Artu''

In Welsh poetry the name is always spelled ''Arthur'' and is exclusively rhymed with words ending in ''-ur''—never words ending in ''-wr''—which confirms that the second element cannot be ''[g]wr'' "man".<ref>See {{Harvnb|Higham|2002|p= 74}}.</ref><ref>See {{Harvnb|Higham|2002|p= 80}}.</ref>

An alternative theory, which has gained only limited acceptance among professional scholars, derives the name Arthur from [[Arcturus]], the brightest star in the constellation [[Boötes]], near [[Ursa Major]] or the Great Bear.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chambers|1964|page= 170}}; {{Harvnb|Bromwich|1978|page= 544}}; {{Harvnb|Johnson|2002|pp= 38–39}}; {{Harvnb|Walter|2005|page= 74}}; {{Harvnb|Zimmer|2006|page= 37}}; {{Harvnb|Zimmer|2009}}</ref> Classical Latin ''Arcturus'' would also have become ''Art(h)ur'' when borrowed into Welsh, and its brightness and position in the sky led people to regard it as the "guardian of the bear" (which is the meaning of the name in Ancient Greek) and the "leader" of the other stars in Boötes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Anderson|2004|pp= 28–29}}; {{Harvnb|Green|2007b|pp= 191–194}}.</ref>

It was first published in 1859 and sold 10,000 copies within the first week.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|Brewer|1983|p= 127}}</ref> In the ''Idylls'', Arthur became a symbol of ideal manhood who ultimately failed, through human weakness, to establish a perfect kingdom on earth.<ref>See {{Harvnb|Rosenberg|1973}} and {{Harvnb|Taylor|Brewer|1983|pp= 89–128}} for analyses of ''The Idylls of the King''.</ref> Tennyson's works prompted a large number of imitators, generated considerable public interest in the legends of Arthur and the character himself, and brought Malory's tales to a wider audience.<ref>See, for example, {{Harvnb|Simpson|1990}}.</ref> Indeed, the first modernisation of Malory's great compilation of Arthur's tales was published in 1862, shortly after ''Idylls'' appeared, and there were six further editions and five competitors before the century ended.<ref>{{Harvnb|Staines|1996|p= 449}}</ref>

This interest in the "Arthur of romance" and his associated stories continued through the 19th century and into the 20th, and influenced poets such as [[William Morris]] and [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artists including [[Edward Burne-Jones]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|Brewer|1983|pp= 127–161}}; {{Harvnb|Mancoff|1990}}.</ref> Even the humorous tale of [[Tom Thumb]], which had been the primary manifestation of Arthur's legend in the 18th century, was rewritten after the publication of ''Idylls''

In particular, Arthur features in a number of well-known ''vitae'' ("[[hagiography|Lives]]") of post-Roman [[saint]]s, none of which are now generally considered to be reliable historical sources (the earliest probably dates from the 11th century).<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|1991a}}</ref> According to the ''Life of Saint [[Gildas]]'', written in the early 12th century by [[Caradoc of Llancarfan]], Arthur is said to have killed Gildas' brother Hueil and to have rescued his wife [[Gwenhwyfar]] from Glastonbury.<ref>Translated in {{Harvnb|Coe|Young|1995|pp= 22–27}}
