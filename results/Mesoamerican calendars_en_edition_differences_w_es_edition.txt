Mesoamerican calendars

en edition's differences with the es version:

3. 
The post-Classic Maya used an abbreviated [[Maya calendar#Short Count|short count]].

The second of the major calendars was one representing a 365-day period approximating the [[tropical year]], known sometimes as the "[[Year#Vague year|vague year]]".<ref>Miller and Taube (1993, p.50)</ref> Because it was an approximation, over time the seasons and the true tropical year gradually "wandered" with respect to this calendar, owing to the accumulation of the differences in length.

==Ritual 260-day calendar==
{{See also|Tōnalpōhualli|Tzolkʼin}}
In the 260-day cycle 20 day names pairs with 13 day numbers, totalling a cycle of 260 days. 

7. 
339-340)</ref>

===The five unlucky days===
The five unlucky days were called nemontemi in Mexico. 

8. 
This is close to the average number of days between the ''first missed'' menstrual period and birth, unlike [[Naegele's rule]] which is 40 weeks (280 days) between the ''last'' menstrual period and birth. 

9. 
We do know though, that in the Maya-area these five days (called Wayeb in Maya) were always the very last days of the year. 

10. 
The nemontemi were seen as 'the useless days' or the days that were dedicated to no gods, and they had prognostic power for the coming year. 

11. 
The 365 day year had no leap year so it varied from the solar year by a quarter of a day each year. 

12.

==Religion and calendrics==
===Lords of the day===
In the post-classic Aztec calendar, there were 13 [[Lords of the Day]].

==Long Count==
{{main|Mesoamerican Long Count calendar}}

[[Image:Estela C de Tres Zapotes.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The back of Stela C from [[Tres Zapotes]], an Olmec archaeological site.<br>This is the second oldest Long Count date yet discovered. 

15. 
Many Maya Long Count inscriptions also have a [[Maya calendar#Supplementary Series|supplementary series]] which can record which one of the nine [[Lords of the Night]] rules, a [[Maya calendar#Lunar Series|Lunar series]] which has information about the lunar cycle, such as [[lunar phase]] and position of the [[Moon]] in a six [[lunation]] cycle and length of the current lunation and an [[Maya calendar#819-day count|819-day count]]. 

16. 

==365-day calendar==
This 365-day calendar corresponded was divided into 18 'months' of 20 days each, plus 5 'nameless' days at the end of the year. 

17. 
This calendar system was probably developed by the [[Olmec]]s and later adopted by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The use of the long count is best attested among the classic Maya, it is not known to have been used by the central Mexican cultures.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The Long Count calendar identifies a date by counting the number of days from August 11, 3114 BCE in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]] or September 6, 3114 BCE in the Julian Calendar (-3113 astronomical). 

18. 

==Maya Calendar==
{{main|Maya calendar}}
The Maya version of the 260-day calendar is commonly known to scholars as the ''[[Tzolk'in|Tzolkin]]'', or ''Tzolk'in'' in the revised [[orthography]] of the [[Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala]].<ref>Refer ALMG (1988), as cited in Kettunen and Hemke (2005, p.5).

==Other cycles==
Other calendar cycles were also recorded, such as a [[Moon|lunar]] calendar, as well as the cycles of other [[astronomy|astronomical]] objects, most importantly [[Venus]].<ref>Balkansky (2002); Miller and Taube (1992, pp.52–54)</ref>

==Calendar Round==
Since both the 260-day and the 365-day calendar repeat, approximately every 52 years they reach a common end, and a new [[Calendar Round]] begins. 

22. 
The date of birth was also used to give names to both humans and gods in many Mesoamerican cultures; some cultures used only the calendar name whereas others combined it with a given name. 

23. 

The use of Mesoamerican calendrics is one of the cultural traits that [[Paul Kirchoff]] used in his original formulation to define Mesoamerica as a [[culture area]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Mesoamerica: Our Region | work = Mesoamerica | url = http://www.mesoamerica.com/ing_nuestra_region.shtml | accessdate = 2006-12-19 | quote = Paul Kirchhoff coined the term, ''Mesoamerica'' in 1943 from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wikt:meso-|mesos]]'' or "center" and ''[[Americas|America]]''. 

24. 

==Central Mexican Calendar==
{{main|Aztec calendar}}
[[File:Descripción histórica y cronológica de las dos piedras que con ocasión del nuevo empedrado que se está formando en la plaza principal de México, se hallaron en ella el año de 1790-1b.jpg|thumb|Image of an ancient Mexican calendar]]
The Central Mexican calendar system is best known in the form that was used by the [[Aztec]]s, but similar calendars were used by the [[Mixtec]]s, [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]]s, [[Tlapanec people|Tlapanecs]], [[Otomi people|Otomi]], [[Matlatzinca people|Matlatzinca]], [[Totonac]], [[Huastec people|Huastecs]], [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] and at [[Teotihuacan]]. 

25. 
This 52-year cycle was the most important for most Mesoamericans, with the apparent exception of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] elite until the end of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Era]], who gave equal importance to the [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]].<ref>Miller and Taube (1992, pp.86–88)</ref>
According to their mythology, at the end of one of these 52-year cycles the world would be destroyed by the gods, as it had been, three times in the [[Popul Vuh]] and four times for the [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]]. 

26. 
However, there is evidence to show Mesoamericans were aware of this gradual shifting, which they accounted for in other ways without amending the calendar itself.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

These two 260- and 365-day calendars could also be synchronised to generate the [[Calendar Round]], a period of 18980 days or approximately 52 [[year]]s. 

27. 
This latter notes the general adoption on ALMG orthography among the [[Mayanist]] research community.</ref> The Tzolk'in is combined with the 365-day calendar (known as the ''[[Haab]]'', or ''Haab'''&nbsp;), to form a synchronized cycle lasting for 52 Haabs, called the ''[[Calendar Round]]''.
