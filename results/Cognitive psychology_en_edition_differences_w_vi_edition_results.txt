Subjects did notice if the pitch of the unattended message changed or if it ceased altogether, and some even oriented to the unattended message if their name was mentioned.<ref name="Cherry" />

===Memory===
The two main types of memory are short-term memory and long-term memory; however, short-term memory has become better understood to be working memory
-4.31442e-09

====[[Working memory]]====
Though working memory is often thought of as just short-term memory, it is more clearly defined as the ability to process and maintain temporary information in a wide range of everyday activities in the face of distraction
-2.12568e-09
Access of [[semantic memory]] ranges from slightly to extremely effortful, depending on a number of variables including but not limited to recency of encoding of the information, number of associations it has to other information, frequency of access, and levels of meaning (how deeply it was processed when it was encoded).<ref name=Balota />
* [[Episodic memory]] is the memory of autobiographical events that can be explicitly stated

Many models of working memory have been made

A large part of memory is forgetting, and there is a large debate among psychologists of [[decay theory]] versus [[interference theory]]

3- Long term memory: holds information over an extended period of time which receives information from the short term memory

Other major findings include that participants can't comprehend both passages, when shadowing one passage, they can't report content of the unattended message, they can shadow a message better if the pitches in each ear are different.<ref name="Cherry">{{Cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.1907229|title=Some Experiments on the Recognition of Speech, with One and with Two Ears|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|volume=25|issue=5|pages=975–979|year=1953|last1=Cherry|first1=E

Common phenomena related to metacognition include:
*'''[[Déjà Vu]]:''' feeling of a repeated experience
*'''Cryptomnesia:''' generating thought believing it is unique but it is actually a memory of a past experience, aka unconscious plagiarism

One of the most regarded is the [[Baddeley's model of working memory|Baddeley and Hitch model of working memory]]

Some of the most prominent concepts include:
* Metacognition: Metacognition is a broad concept encompassing all manners of one's thoughts and knowledge about their own thinking

5.96685e-10
Those processes include, but are not limited to, the following three stages of memory:

1-sensory memory storage: holds sensory information 

2-short term memory storage: holds information temporary for analysis and retrieves information form the Long term memory

A key area of educational focus in this realm is related to self-monitoring, which relates highly to how well students are able to evaluate their personal knowledge and apply strategies to improve knowledge in areas in which they are lacking.<ref name="Reif">Reif, F
1.02591e-09

====[[Long-term memory]]====
Modern conceptions of [[memory]] are usually about long-term memory and break it down into three main sub-classes

* [[Declarative knowledge]] and [[procedural knowledge]]: Declarative knowledge is a persons 'encyclopedic' knowledge base, whereas procedural knowledge is specific knowledge relating to performing particular tasks
1.48634e-09
It is often activated on a [[subconscious]] level, or at most requires a minimal amount of [[conscious]] effort.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/43595-procedural-memory.html|title=Procedural Memory: Definition and Examples|work=Live Science|access-date=2018-09-06}}</ref> [[Procedural memory]] includes [[Stimulus-response model|stimulus-response]]-type information, which is activated through association with particular tasks, routines, etc
1.53523e-09
Cognitive psychologists often study memory in terms of [[working memory]]

* [[Procedural memory]] is memory for the performance of particular types of action

History of neuroscience |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref> In 1637, [[René Descartes]] posited that humans are born with innate ideas, and forwarded the idea of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind-body dualism]], which would come to be known as substance dualism (essentially the idea that the mind and the body are two separate substances).<ref name="Malone">Malone, J.C
0.0404722
Two discoveries that would later play substantial roles in cognitive psychology were [[Paul Broca]]'s discovery of the area of the brain largely responsible for language production,<ref name="Malone" /> and [[Carl Wernicke]]'s discovery of an area thought to be mostly responsible for comprehension of language.<ref>Eysenck, M.W
0.0495682
[[Behaviorism]] provided little if any insight into these matters and it was the work of [[Donald Broadbent]], integrating concepts from human performance research and the recently developed [[information theory]], that forged the way in this area.<ref name="Anderson" />
* Developments in computer science would lead to parallels being drawn between human thought and the computational functionality of computers, opening entirely new areas of [[Computationalism|psychological thought]]

===Metacognition===
[[Metacognition]], in a broad sense, is the thoughts that a person has about their own thoughts

Neisser's definition on page 4.</ref> Neisser's definition of "cognition" illustrates the then-progressive concept of cognitive processes:

<blockquote>The term "cognition" refers to all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used

[[Episodic memory]] typically requires the deepest level of [[consciousness|conscious]] thought, as it often pulls together [[semantic memory]] and temporal information to formulate the entire [[memory]].<ref name=Balota />

===Perception===
[[Perception]] involves both the physical senses (sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch, and [[proprioception]]) as well as the [[Cognition|cognitive processes]] involved in interpreting those senses

The child must be able to recognize that they have their own thoughts and in turn, that others possess thoughts of their own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/documents/Astington-EdwardANGxp.pdf |title=Astington, J.W

Cognitive psychologists are often heavily involved in running psychological experiments involving human participants, with the goal of gathering information related to how the human mind takes in, processes, and acts upon inputs received from the outside world.<ref>Baddeley, A

===Attention===
{{main|Attention}}
The psychological definition of [[attention]] is "a state of focused awareness on a subset of the available perceptual information".<ref name=APA>{{cite web|title=How does the APA define "psychology"
0.0743522
Instead of asking how a man's actions and experiences result from what he saw, remembered, or believed, the dynamic psychologist asks how they follow from the subject's goals, needs, or instincts.<ref name=Neisser/></blockquote>

==Mental processes==
{{see also|Cognitive control}}
The main focus of cognitive psychologists is on the [[mental processes]] that affect behavior

An example of the way in which modern psychologists approach the study of [[perception]] is the research being done at the Center for Ecological Study of Perception and Action at the University of Connecticut (CESPA)

The brain is able to consciously handle only a small subset of this information, and this is accomplished through the attentional processes.<ref name=Anderson />

Attention can be divided into two major attentional systems: exogenous control and endogenous control.<ref name="Chicaetal2013">{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2012.09.027|pmid=23000534|title=Two cognitive and neural systems for endogenous and exogenous spatial attention|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|volume=237|pages=107–123|year=2013|last1=Chica|first1=Ana B.|last2=Bartolomeo|first2=Paolo|last3=Lupiáñez|first3=Juan}}</ref> Exogenous control works in a bottom-up manner and is responsible for [[orienting reflex]], and pop-out effects.<ref name="Chicaetal2013" /> Endogenous control works top-down and is the more deliberate attentional system, responsible for divided attention and conscious processing.<ref name="Chicaetal2013" />

One major focal point relating to [[attention]] within the field of cognitive psychology is the concept of divided [[attention]]
