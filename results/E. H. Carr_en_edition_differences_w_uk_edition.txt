During a 1945 lecture series entitled ''The Soviet Impact on the Western World'', which were published as a book in 1946, Carr argued that "The trend away from individualism and towards totalitarianism is everywhere unmistakable", that [[Marxism]] was the by far the most successful type of [[totalitarianism]] as proved by Soviet industrial growth and the [[Red Army]]'s role in defeating Germany and that only the "blind and incurable ignored these trends".<ref name="Laqueur, p.
