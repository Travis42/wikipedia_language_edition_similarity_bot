'''Georges Lefebvre''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɔʁʒ ləfɛvʁ|lang}}; 6 August 1874&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;28 August 1959) was a [[French people|French]] [[historian]], best known for his work on the [[French Revolution]] and [[peasant]] life

Lib.|location=Fairfax|doi=10.2307/286492|jstor=286492}}</ref>  [[Peter Jones (historian)|Peter Jones]] elaborates that Lefebvre’s take on the Revolution has three major emphases: the idea that the countryside peasantry actively participated in the Revolution, the idea that this participation was not significantly influenced by the [[bourgeoisie]], and the idea that the peasants largely agreed on an anticapitalist way of thinking in the 1790s.<ref name="Jones1990" />

==Accomplishments==
