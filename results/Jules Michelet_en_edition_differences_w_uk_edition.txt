Ferguson, ''The Renaissance in historical thought: five centuries of interpretation'' (1948)</ref>

==Themes==
Michelet has several themes running throughout his works, these included the following three categories: Maleficent, Beneficent, and Paired. 

3. 
In terms of the Maleficent themes, there were subcategories these were: Themes of the Dry, which included concepts such as: The Machine, The Jesuits, Scribes, The Electric, Irony (Goethe), The Scholastics, Public Safety, fatalism (Hobbes, Molinos, Spinoza, Hegel). 

4. 
[[File:Vincent van Gogh - Sorrow.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] inscribed ''[[Sorrow (van Gogh)|Sorrow]]'' with the words ''"{{lang|fr|Comment se fait-il qu'il y ait sur la terre une femme seule?}}"'', which translates to ''How can there be on earth a woman alone, abandoned?'' from "{{lang|fr|La Femme}}" ]]

''L'Insecte'' followed. 

5. 
One of these themes was the idea of Paired Themes, for example in many of his works he writes on Grace and Justice, Grace being the Woman or Feminine and Justice being more of a Masculine idea.

Michelet's ''Origines du droit français, cherchées dans les symboles et les formules du droit universel'' was edited by [[Émile Faguet]] in 1890 and went into a second edition in 1900. 

9. 
The first of these deals with the early history up to the death of Charlemagne, the second with the flourishing time of feudal France, the third with the 13th century, the fourth, fifth, and sixth with the [[Hundred Years' War]], the seventh and eighth with the establishment of the royal power under [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] and [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]]. 

10. 
In the next, ''L'Oiseau'' (1856), a new and most successful vein was struck: The subject of natural history, a new subject with Michelet to which his wife introduced him, was treated, not from the point of view of mere science, nor from that of sentiment, but from that of the author's fervent [[pantheism]]. 

11. 
The 16th and 17th centuries have four volumes apiece, much of which is very distantly connected with French history proper, especially in the two volumes entitled ''Renaissance'' and ''Reforme''.

==Academic reception==
Michelet was perhaps the first historian to devote himself to anything like a picturesque history of the [[Middle Ages]], and his account is still one of the most vivid that exists.
