The bibliographer utilizes knowledge gained from the investigation of physical evidence in the form of a descriptive bibliography or textual bibliography.<ref name="New Encyclopædia Britannica: Macropaedia">{{cite book|last=Bowers|first=Fredson|title=Bibliography|year=1974|edition=2nd|pages=978–981}}</ref> Descriptive bibliography is the close examination and cataloging of a text as a physical object, recording its size, format, [[bookbinding|binding]], and so on, while textual bibliography (or textual criticism) identifies variations—and the aetiology of variations—in a text with a view to determining "the establishment of the most correct form of [a] text" (Bowers 498[1])

In addition to viewing bibliographic study as being composed of four interdependent approaches (enumerative, descriptive, analytical, and textual), Bowers notes two further subcategories of research, namely historical bibliography and aesthetic bibliography.<ref>Fredson Bowers, "Four Faces of Bibliography" Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada 10 (1971):33-4.</ref> Both historical bibliography, which involves the investigation of printing practices, tools, and related documents, and aesthetic bibliography, which examines the art of designing type and books, are often employed by analytical bibliographers
