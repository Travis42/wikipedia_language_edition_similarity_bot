How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

Philosophy
In a philosophical sense, every event is about the perseverance of an alteration in which, articulate and function, in a contingent and paradoxical sense, multiple and heterogeneous random, singular and productive mechanisms of experiences and subjectivities are combined, articulated and functioned. 

7. 
Thus, it is something that happens, which takes place in a certain region of geography (of space) and in a certain time interval (and that interval could be a moment, could be of short duration, or it could cover several days as in the given example of the 1936 Olympic Games). 

8. 
Then taking bath, whistle, and inventing a new technique, are actually three different events, which are generated all three, at the same time and the same place.

Another central debate in philosophy is this: How should events be understood.

12. 
More are those who do not accept the idea of ''possible worlds'', and only consider that an event is something that has already already happened, or that is happening, or that at some point will happen; Thus, only the current facts and states of things are events, and then the possibility of considering contingent events is rejected.
