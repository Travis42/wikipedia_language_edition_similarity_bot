===Adolescence===
{{Main|Adolescent psychology}}
Adolescence is the period of life between the onset of puberty and the full commitment to an adult social role, such as worker, parent, and/or citizen. 

2. 
Lastly, post-conventional moral reasoning is a stage during which the individual sees society's rules and conventions as relative and subjective, rather than as authoritative.<ref name="Adolescence3">{{cite book|title=Adolescence|last=Steinberg|first=Laurence|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-340548-3|edition=8th|location=Boston|pages=60–365|authorlink=Laurence Steinberg}}</ref>

He suggested three levels of moral reasoning; pre-conventional moral reasoning, conventional moral reasoning, and post-conventional moral reasoning. 

5. 

Theorists have proposed four types of attachment styles:<ref name="Schacter4402">{{cite book|title=Psychology|last=Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner|publisher=Worth|year=2011|pages=440}}</ref> secure, anxious-avoidant, anxious-resistant,<ref name="Adolescence3"/> and disorganized.<ref name="Schacter4402" /> Secure attachment is a healthy attachment between the infant and the caregiver.

Children as young as 4 years-old have verbatim memory, memory for surface information, which increases up to early adulthood, at which point it begins to decline. 

7. 
On the other hand, our capacity for gist memory, memory for semantic information, increases up to early adulthood, at which point it is consistent through old age. 

8. 
 Affirming a role for fathers, studies have shown that children as young as 15 months benefit significantly from substantial engagement with their father.<ref name="aredos">{{cite web|url=http://www.ericdigests.org/2004-3/role.html|title=Fathers' Role in Children's Academic Achievement and Early Literacy.

All parents have their own parenting styles. 

12. 
Individuals create meaning for themselves or make sense of new information by selecting, organizing, and integrating information with other knowledge, often in the context of social interactions. 

13. 
 The pre-conventional moral reasoning is typical of children and is characterized by reasoning that is based on rewards and punishments associated with different courses of action. 

14. 
He believed that these stages are not separate from one another, but rather that each stage builds on the previous one in a continuous learning process.

====Infant cognition: the Piagetian era====
Piaget suggested that an infant's perception and understanding of the world depended on their motor development, which was required for the infant to link visual, tactile and motor representations of objects.<ref>Lefmann, T. 

18. 

The nativist position argues that the input from language is too impoverished for infants and children to acquire the structure of language. 

19. 
This has led to the idea that there is a special cognitive [[modularity of mind|module]] suited for learning language, often called the [[language acquisition device]]. 

20. 
An important characteristic of this age period is the [[Language development|development of language]], where children are learning how to communicate and express their emotions and desires through the use of vocal sounds, babbling, and eventually words.<ref name=Upton>{{cite book|last=Upton|first=Penney|title=Developmental Psychology: Critical Thinking in Psychology|year=2011|publisher=Learning Matters|location=Exeter|isbn=978-0-85725-276-0|page=62}}</ref> Self-control also begins to develop.

Studies have shown that the development of ER is affected by the emotional regulation children observe in parents and caretakers, the emotional climate in the home, and the reaction of parents and caretakers to the child's emotions.<ref>Amanda Morris et al. 

24. 
 The environmental hypothesis explains how children with coordination problems and [[developmental coordination disorder]] are exposed to several psychosocial consequences which act as secondary stressors, leading to an increase in [[Internalizing disorder|internalizing symptoms]] such as depression and anxiety.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal|last1=Cairney|first1=John|last2=Veldhuizen|first2=Scott|last3=Szatmari|first3=Peter|title=Motor coordination and emotional-behavioral problems in children|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=2010|volume=23|issue=4|pages=324–329|doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e32833aa0aa|pmid=20520549}}</ref>  Motor coordination problems affect fine and gross motor movement as well as perceptual-motor skills.

R.}}</ref> Toddlers often use their new-found language abilities to voice their desires, but are often misunderstood by parents due to their language skills just beginning to develop. 

28. 
People change rapidly and step up to a new level, and then change very little for a while. 

29. 
Among African American adolescents, authoritative parenting is not associated with academic achievement without peer support for achievement.<ref name=Taylor /> Children who are raised by authoritative parents are "more likely to become independent, self-reliant, socially accepted, academically successful, and well-behaved. 

30. 
Lastly, the chronosystem refers to the chronological nature of life events and how they interact and change the individual and their circumstances through transition (example: a mother losing her own mother to illness and no longer having that support in her life).<ref name="Edpsych24"/>

Infants can be seen to have six states, grouped into pairs:
* quiet sleep and active sleep ([[dream]]ing, when [[REM sleep]] occurs)
* quiet waking, and active waking

====Infant perception====
Infant perception is what a newborn can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. 

33. 

[[Emotional self-regulation|Emotional regulation]] or ER refers to an individual's ability to modulate emotional responses across a variety of contexts.

An example of anxious attachment during adulthood is when the adult chooses a partner with anxious-avoidant attachment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/compassion-matters/201307/how-your-attachment-style-impacts-your-relationship|title=How Your Attachment Style Impacts Your Relationship|website=Psychology Today|publisher=Compassion Matters|last1=Firestone|first1=Lisa}}</ref>

==Major debates==
{{More citations needed section|date=April 2017}}

===Nature vs nurture===
A significant issue in developmental psychology is the relationship between innateness and environmental influence in regard to any particular aspect of development. 

36. 
The empiricist position on the issue of language acquisition suggests that the language input provides the necessary information required for learning the structure of language and that infants acquire language through a process of [[statistical learning]]. 

37. 
Anxious-resistant is an insecure attachment between the infant and the caregiver characterized by distress from the infant when separated and anger when reunited.<ref name="Adolescence3" /> Disorganized is an attachment style without a consistent pattern of responses upon return of the parent.<ref name="Schacter4402" />

A child can be hindered in its natural tendency to form attachments.

Parental warmth refers to the degree to which parents are accepting and responsive to their children's behavior."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kopoko|first1=Kimberly|title=Parenting Styles and Adolescents|journal=Cornell University Cooperative Extension|date=2007|pages=1–8|url=http://www.human.cornell.edu/pam/outreach/parenting/research/upload/Parenting-20Styles-20and-20Adolescents.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref>

===Parenting styles===
The following [[parenting styles]] have been described in the child development literature:

* Authoritative parenting is characterized as parents who have high parental warmth, responsiveness, and demandingness, but rate low in negativity and conflict.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Lorraine C.|author2=Clayton, Jennifer D.

Traditional measures of physical maturity using x-rays are less in practice nowadays, compared to simple measurements of body parts such as height, weight, head circumference, and arm span.<ref name="Eaton" />

A few other studies and practices with physical developmental psychology are the phonological abilities of mature 5- to 11-year-olds, and the controversial hypotheses of left-handers being maturationally delayed compared to right-handers.

====Language====
{{Main|Language development}}
Babies are born with the ability to discriminate virtually all sounds of all human languages.<ref name=Berk />{{rp|189}} Infants of around six months can differentiate between [[phoneme]]s in their own language, but not between similar phonemes in another language. 

43. 

Piaget came to his conclusion that infants lacked a complete understanding of object permanence before 18 months after observing infants' failure before this age to look for an object where it was last seen. 

44. 
Color perception similar to that seen in adults has been demonstrated in infants as young as four months, using habituation methods.<ref name="butterworth" /> Infants get to adult-like vision in about six months.<ref name="Berk" />{{rp|191}}
* [[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] is well-developed prior to birth, unlike vision. 

45. 
From this perspective, language can be acquired via general learning methods that also apply to other aspects of development, such as [[perceptual learning]]. 

46. 
These parents are typically disengaged in their child's lives, lacking structure in their parenting styles and are unsupportive.<ref name=Baumrind />  Children in this category are typically the least competent of all the categories.<ref name=Baumrind />

===Mother and father factors===
Parenting roles in child development have typically focused on the role of the mother. 

47. 
 The outcomes are more harmful for middle-class boys than girls, preschool white girls than preschool black girls, and for white boys than Hispanic boys.<ref name=Baumrind /> Furthermore, the negative effects of authoritarian parenting among Asian Americans can be offset by positive peer support.<ref name=Taylor /> Finally, among African Americans, some elements of authoritarian parenting such as firm control and physical discipline do not serve as predictive factors for negative outcomes.<ref name=Taylor />
* Permissive parenting is characterized by high levels of responsiveness combined with low levels of demandingness.<ref name=Baumrind /> These parents are lenient and do not necessarily require mature behavior.<ref name=Baumrind />  They allow for a high degree of self-regulation and typically avoid confrontation.<ref name=Baumrind />  Compared to children raised using the authoritative style, preschool girls raised in permissive families are less assertive.<ref name=Baumrind />  Additionally, preschool children of both sexes are less cognitively competent than those children raised under authoritative parenting styles.<ref name=Baumrind />
* Rejecting or neglectful parenting is the final category. 

48. 
These axioms are: a) defined in terms of tasks at the next lower order of hierarchical complexity task action; b) defined as the higher order task action that organizes two or more less complex actions; that is, the more complex action specifies the way in which the less complex actions combine; c) defined as the lower order task actions have to be carried out non-arbitrarily.

Instead, infants continue to look for an object where it was first seen, committing the "[[A-not-B error]]." Some researchers have suggested that before the age of eight to nine months, infants' inability to understand object permanence extends to people, which explains why infants at this age do not cry when their mothers are gone ("Out of sight, out of mind").

===Research designs===
Most developmental studies, regardless of whether they employ the experimental, correlational, or case study method, can also be constructed using research designs.<ref name=Bruning /> Research designs are logical frameworks used to make key comparisons within research studies such as:
* [[cross-sectional design]]
* [[longitudinal design]]
* [[cohort study|sequential design]]
* [[microgenetic design]]

In a [[longitudinal study]], a researcher observes many individuals born at or around the same time (a [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]]) and carries out new observations as members of the cohort age.

[[File:Bronfenbrenner's_Ecological_Theory_of_Development_(English).jpg|right|thumb|180x180px|{{center|Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory}}]]
Ecological systems theory, originally formulated by [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]], specifies four types of nested environmental systems, with bi-directional influences within and between the systems.
