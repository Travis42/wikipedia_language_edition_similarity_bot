Early [[geologists]] such as [[Nicolas Steno]] (1638-1686) and [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure]] (1740-1799) had developed ideas of [[Stratum|geological strata]] forming from water through chemical processes, which [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] (1749–1817) developed into a theory known as [[Neptunism]], envisaging the slow crystallisation of minerals in the ancient oceans of the Earth to form [[rock (geology)|rock]]
