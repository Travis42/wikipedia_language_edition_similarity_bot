Most of the generated D body is discharged out of the body by physiological action

However, the D body incorporated in the teeth [[enamel] and [ivory] is not discharged out of the body, it accumulates with age

Therefore, by examining the ratio of the D body and The L body of the amino acid contained in the tooth, it is [remains]] it is necessary to know the estimated death age of [remains]] ref name

The ''amino acid dating method'' is a type of [physicochemical age] measurement method used for [archaeology] and [forensic science]

Half-life of carbon 14 is about 5730 years, since the half-life of the amino acid is longer than this, about 50,000 years was expected as an alternative to the radiocarbon dating method of the limit [ref name

The concentration of d body in the teeth, 1% if the death age 10 years old, is about 3% if 60 years old

However, there is also a report that it is effective when there is no other suitable measurement method, such as when determining the age of about 100,000 to 1 million years of siliceous sediments on the seabed<ref> [Research on the age measurement of submarine sediments using the http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/jepsjmo/cd-rom/2000cd-rom/pdf/gb/gb-011.pdf amino acid racemicization reaction] </ref>

This method was conceived by an American physicist [Philip Abelson] and developed by [Jeffrey Bader].</a0>

For example, [Aspartic acid] is fast rate of racemicization <ref name .kans /> is half of the L body in 15,000 years if the temperature is 20 degrees C., ref name .ibu> [Relics tell] </ref>

Even at high temperatures of about 100 degrees C., racemicization by chemical reactions is hardly generated if about 6 hours, hardly occurs, it is difficult to become a factor of error<ref> [http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110002909858 the influence of acid hydrolysis in the age estimation method using the racemicization reaction of the vaginal amino acid] </ref>
