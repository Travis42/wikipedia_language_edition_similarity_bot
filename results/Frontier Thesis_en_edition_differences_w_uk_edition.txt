Whereas Turner saw the development of American character occur just behind the frontier line, as the colonists tamed and tilled the land, Roosevelt saw it form in battles just beyond the frontier line.

A similarly race-based interpretation of Western history also occupied the intellectual sphere in the United States before Turner.

Other historians, who wanted to focus scholarship on minorities, especially Native Americans and Hispanics, started in the 1970s to criticize the frontier thesis because it did not attempt to explain the evolution of those groups.<ref>Nichols (1986)</ref> Indeed, their approach was to reject the frontier as an important process and to study the West as a region, ignoring the frontier experience east of the Mississippi River.<ref>Milner (1991)</ref>

In the thesis, the American frontier established liberty by releasing Americans from European mindsets and eroding old, dysfunctional customs.

In so doing, the Anglo-Saxons and the Germanic people’s descendants, being exposed to a forest like their Teutonic ancestors, birthed the free political institutions that formed the foundation of American government.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ostrander |first1=Gilman |title=Turner and the Germ Theory |journal=Agricultural History |date=October 1958 |volume=32 |issue=4 |page=259 |jstor=3740063 }}</ref>

==Early anti-Turnerian thought==
Though Turner’s work was massively popular in its time and for decades after, it received significant intellectual pushback in the midst of World War II.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ostrander |first1=Gilman |title=Turner and the Germ Theory |journal=Agricultural History |date=October 1958 |volume=32 |issue=4 |page=261 |jstor=3740063 }}</ref> This quote from Turner’s The Frontier in American History is arguably the most famous statement of his work and, to later historians, the most controversial:

He asked why the Turnerian American character was limited to English settlements in the New World, and why the frontier did not produce that same character among Native Americans and Spaniards.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pierson |first1=George |title=The Frontier and American Institutions: A Criticism of the Turner Theory |journal=New England Quarterly |date=June 1942 |volume=15 |page=253 }}</ref>

Despite Pierson and other scholars’ work, Turner’s influence did not end during World War II or even after the war.

Though Roosevelt would later accept Turner’s historiography on the West, calling Turner’s work a correction or supplementation of his own, the two certainly contradict.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Slotkin |first1=Richard |title=Nostalgia and Progress: Theodore Roosevelt's Myth of the Frontier |journal=American Quarterly |date=Winter 1981 |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=608–637 |jstor=2712805 |doi=10.2307/2712805 |url=https://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/div2facpubs/31 }}</ref>

Roosevelt was not entirely unfounded in saying that he and Turner agreed; both Turner and Roosevelt agreed that the frontier had shaped what would become distinctly American institutions and the mysterious entity they each called “national character.” They also agreed that studying the history of the West was necessary to face [[Gilded Age|the challenges to democracy in the late 1890s]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Slotkin |first1=Richard |title=Nostalgia and Progress: Theodore Roosevelt's Myth of the Frontier |journal=American Quarterly |date=Winter 1981 |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=608–637 |jstor=2712805 |doi=10.2307/2712805 |url=https://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/div2facpubs/31 }}</ref>

Turner and Roosevelt diverged on the exact aspect of frontier life that shaped the contemporary American.

Though Turner’s view would win over the Germanic germ theory’s version of Western history, the theory persisted for decades after Turner’s thesis enraptured the American Historical Association. 

38. 
Turner referred to the Germanic germ theory by name in his essay, claiming that “too exclusive attention has been paid by institutional students to the Germanic origins.”<ref>{{cite web |last1=Turner |first1=Frederick |title=The Frontier in American History |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22994/22994-h/22994-h.htm |website=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref> Turner believed that historians should focus on the settlers’ struggle with the frontier as the catalyst for the creation of American character, not racial or hereditary traits. 

39. 
Turner elaborated on the theme in his advanced history lectures and in a series of essays published over the next 25 years, published along with his initial paper as ''The Frontier in American History.''<ref>Turner, ''The Frontier in American History'' (1920) chapter 1</ref>

Turner's emphasis on the importance of the frontier in shaping American character influenced the interpretation found in thousands of scholarly histories. 

40. 
Proponents of the germ theory believed that political habits are determined by innate racial attributes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ostrander |first1=Gilman |title=Turner and the Germ Theory |journal=Agricultural History |date=October 1958 |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=258–261 |jstor=3740063 }}</ref> Americans inherited such traits as adaptability and self-reliance from the Germanic peoples of Europe.

The '''Frontier Thesis''' or '''Turner Thesis''', is the argument advanced by historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] in 1893 that [[American democracy]] was formed by the [[American frontier]].

The traits of the frontier are “coarseness and strength combined with acuteness and inquisitiveness; that practical, inventive turn of mind, quick to find expedients; that masterful grasp of material things, lacking in the artistic but powerful to effect great ends; that restless, nervous energy; that dominant individualism, working for good and for evil, and withal that buoyancy and exuberance which comes with freedom.” 

Turner concludes the essay by saying that with the end of the frontier, the first period of American history has ended.<ref>{{cite book|author=Turner, Frederick Jackson|title=The Frontier in American History|page = 293|chapter = The Significance of the Frontier in American History|year=1920|chapter-url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/turner/}}</ref>
