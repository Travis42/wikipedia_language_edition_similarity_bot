(The slope became shallower in the 2000s (decade), because of a slight acceleration of Earth's crust temporarily shortening the day.) Vertical position on the graph corresponds to the accumulation of this difference over time, and the vertical segments correspond to leap seconds introduced to match this accumulated difference

Near the end of the 20th century, the length of the mean solar day (also known simply as "length of day" or "LOD") was approximately 86,400.0013&nbsp;s.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=54}} For this reason, UT is now "slower" than TAI by the difference (or "excess" LOD) of 1.3&nbsp;ms/day

In 1968, [[Louis Essen]], the inventor of the caesium atomic clock, and G.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Winkler both independently proposed that steps should be of 1&nbsp;second only.{{sfn| Essen| 1968| pp=161–5}} This system was eventually approved, along with the idea of maintaining the UTC second equal to the TAI second
0.0205687
The ephemeris second is a unit in the system of time that, when used as the independent variable in the laws of motion that govern the movement of the planets and moons in the solar system, enables the laws of motion to accurately predict the observed positions of solar system bodies
0.0314192
The extra second is called a leap second
0.0314192
The length of second so defined was practically equal to the second of ephemeris time.{{sfn|Markowitz|1988}} This was the frequency that had been provisionally used in TAI since 1958
0.0314192
It was soon recognised that having two types of second with different lengths, namely the UTC second and the SI second used in TAI, was a bad idea
0.0314192
Since the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]] word for ''Z'' is "Zulu", UTC is sometimes known as "Zulu time"

While the rate due to [[tidal friction]] alone is about 2.3&nbsp;ms/cy, the [[Post-glacial rebound|uplift]] of [[Canada]] and [[Scandinavia]] by several metres since the last [[Ice Age]] has temporarily reduced this to 1.7&nbsp;ms/cy over the last 2,700&nbsp;years.{{sfn | Stephenson | Morrison | 1995}} The correct reason for leap seconds, then, is not the current difference between actual and nominal LOD, but rather the ''accumulation'' of this difference over a period of time: Near the end of the 20th&nbsp;century, this difference was about 1/800 of a second per day; therefore, after about 800 days, it accumulated to 1&nbsp;second (and a leap second was then added)
0.0321825

Just as adding a leap day every four years does not mean the year is getting longer by one day every four years, the insertion of a leap second every 800 days does not indicate that the mean solar day is getting longer by a second every 800 days
0.0453833
In contrast, astronomical GMT began at mean noon, 12 hours ''after'' mean midnight of the same date until 1 January 1925, whereas nautical GMT began at mean noon, 12&nbsp;hours ''before'' mean midnight of the same date, at least until 1805 in the [[Royal Navy]], but persisted much later elsewhere because it was mentioned at the 1884 conference
0.0488743

In April 2001, Rob Seaman of the [[National Optical Astronomy Observatory]] proposed that leap seconds be allowed to be added monthly rather than twice yearly.<ref>{{cite web|first=Rob |last=Seaman |title=Upgrade, don't degrade |date=9 April 2001 |accessdate=10 September 2015 |url=http://iraf.noao.edu/~seaman/leap/leapsec.txt |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602095155/http://iraf.noao.edu/~seaman/leap/leapsec.txt |archivedate=2 June 2013 }}</ref>

There is a proposal to redefine UTC and abolish leap seconds, so that [[sundial]]s would very slowly get further out of sync with civil time.{{sfn | Allen | 2011b}} The resulting gradual shift of the sun's movements relative to civil time is analogous to the shift of [[season]]s relative to the yearly calendar that results from the calendar year not precisely matching the [[tropical year]] length
0.0518391
The current use of only the leap second opportunities in June and December will be insufficient to maintain a difference of less than 1 second, and it might be decided to introduce leap seconds in March and September
0.0598586
As a result, the SI&nbsp;second is close to 1/86400 of a mean solar day in the mid‑19th century.{{sfn|McCarthy|Seidelmann|2009|p=87}} In earlier centuries, the mean solar day was shorter than 86,400 SI seconds, and in more recent centuries it is longer than 86,400 seconds
0.0740558
By extension, it is not possible to compute the precise duration of a time interval that ends in the future and may encompass an unknown number of leap seconds (for example, the number of TAI seconds between "now" and 2099-12-31 23:59:59)

| 2016}} Leap seconds are inserted as necessary to keep UTC within 0.9&nbsp;seconds of [[Universal time#Versions|the UT1 variant of universal time]].{{sfn | National Institute of Standards and Technology | 2012}} See the "[[#Current number of leap seconds|Current number of leap seconds]]" section for the number of leap seconds inserted to date
0.0831274
UTC is within about one second of [[Solar time#Mean solar time|mean solar time]] at [[Prime meridian|0° longitude]],{{sfn|Guinot|2011|page=S181}} so that, because the [[mean solar day]] is slightly longer than 86,400 SI seconds, occasionally the last minute of a UTC day is adjusted to have 61&nbsp;seconds
