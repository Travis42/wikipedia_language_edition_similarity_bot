How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

Eternity of the world

en edition's differences with the ko version: 


1. 
 Consequently, the underlying matter of the universe could have come into existence only from an already existing matter exactly like itself; to assume that the underlying matter of the universe came into existence would require assuming that an underlying matter already existed. 

2. 
 According to Maimonides, to argue that "because I have never observed something coming into existence without coming from a substratum it cannot occur" is equivalent to arguing that "because I cannot [[Empiricism|empirically]] observe eternity it does not exist."

Maimonides himself held that neither creation nor Aristotle's infinite time were provable, or at least that no proof was available. 

3. 
 If the existence of something requires that something else exist before it, then the first thing cannot come into existence without the thing before it existing. 

4. 

==Medieval period==
[[Avicenna]] argued that {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} prior to a thing's coming into actual existence, its existence must have been '[[Logical possibility|possible]].'  Were its existence [[necessary truth|necessary]], the thing would already have existed, and were its existence impossible, the thing would never exist. 

5. 
As this assumption is self-contradictory, Aristotle argued, matter must be eternal.<ref>''Physics'' I, 7</ref>

In Book VIII, his argument from [[Motion (physics)|motion]] is that if an absolute beginning of motion should be assumed, the object to undergo the first motion must either 
:(A) have come into existence and begun to move, or 
:(B) have existed in an eternal state of rest before beginning to move.<ref>Aristotle in Physics VIII, 1, 251a, 8-20</ref>

Option A is self-contradictory because an object cannot move before it comes into existence, and the act of coming into existence is itself a "movement," so that the first movement requires a movement before it, that is, the act of coming into existence. 

6. 
But an efficient cause, such as God, which instantaneously produces its effect would not necessarily precede its effect in duration. 

7. 
 If an already existent matter must precede everything coming into existence, clearly nothing, including matter, can come into existence ''[[ex nihilo]]'', that is, from absolute nothingness. 

8. 
 God can also be distinguished from a natural cause which produces its effect by [[Motion (physics)|motion]], for a cause that produces motion must precede its effect. 

9. 
* First, if the world began at a state of rest, the coming into existence of that state of rest would itself have been motion. 

10. 
* Second, if the world changed from a state of rest to a state of motion, the cause of that change to motion would itself have been a motion. 

11. 
Since an actual infinite in reality would create logical contradictions, it can not exist including the actual infinite set of past events. 

12. 
Therefore, if the underlying matter of the universe came into existence, it would come into existence from a substratum. 

13. 
The first premise is defended by a reductio ad absurdum where Philoponus shows that actual infinites can not exist in the actual world because they would lead to contradictions albeit being a possible mathematical enterprise. 

14. 
The second argument, the "argument from the impossibility of completing an actual infinite by successive addition", states:<ref name=Craig/>

:"An actual infinite cannot be completed by successive addition."
:"The temporal series of past events has been completed by successive addition."
:"Thus the temporal series of past events cannot be an actual infinite."

The first statement states, correctly, that a finite (number) cannot be made into an infinite one by the finite addition of more finite numbers. 

15. 
 But since Aristotle holds that such treatments of infinity are impossible and ridiculous, the world cannot have existed for infinite time.<ref>{{cite news |last=Daniels |first=Mark |date= |title=What's New in Ancient Philosophy |work=Philosopny Now |url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/20/Whats_New_in_Ancient_Philosophy}}{{full citation needed|date=March 2016|reason=needs a date as this is a series}}</ref>

Philoponus's works were adopted by many; his first argument against an infinite past being the "argument from the impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite", which states:<ref name=Craig>{{Cite journal |last=Craig |first=William Lane |date=June 1979 |title=Whitrow and Popper on the Impossibility of an Infinite Past |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |volume=30 |issue=2  |pages=165–170 [165–166] |doi=10.1093/bjps/30.2.165 }}</ref>
:"An actual infinite cannot exist."
:"An infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite."
:"Thus an infinite temporal regress of events cannot exist."

This argument defines event as equal increments of time. 

16. 
The conservative position is that the world can be logically proved to have begun in time, of which the classic exposition is Bonaventure's argument in the second book of his commentary on [[Sentences|Peter Lombard's sentences]], where he repeats Philoponus' case against a traversal of the infinite.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[Aquinas|Thomas Aquinas]], like Maimonides, argued against both the conservative theologians and the Averroists, claiming that neither the eternity nor the finite nature of the world could be proved by logical argument alone.
