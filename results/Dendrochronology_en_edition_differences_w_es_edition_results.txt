While dendrochronology has become an important tool for dating oak panels, it is not effective in dating the poplar panels often used by Italian painters because of the erratic growth rings in poplar.<ref>[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/dendrochronology National Portrait Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017120656/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/dendrochronology |date=2013-10-17 }}</ref>

The sixteenth century saw a gradual replacement of wooden panels by canvas as the support for paintings, which means the technique is less often applicable to later paintings.<ref>[http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/education/panelpaintings/ The Getty Conservation Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123200401/http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/education/panelpaintings/ |date=2013-11-23 }}</ref> In addition, many panel paintings were [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred onto canvas or other supports]] during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries

A tree's growth rate changes in a predictable pattern throughout the year in response to seasonal climate changes, resulting in visible growth rings

The techniques of dendrochronology are more consistent in areas where trees grew in marginal conditions such as aridity or semi-aridity where the ring growth is more sensitive to the environment, rather than in humid areas where tree-ring growth is more uniform (complacent)

Growth rings result from new growth in the [[vascular cambium]], a layer of cells near the [[bark (botany)|bark]] that botanists classify as a [[lateral meristem]]; this growth in diameter is known as [[secondary growth]]

33, stated that Carl Linnaeus (1745, 1751) in Sweden, Friedrich August Ludwig von Burgsdorf (1783) in Germany, and Alphonse de Candolle (1839–1840) in France subsequently observed the same tree ring in their samples.</ref> In the U.S., [[Alexander Catlin Twining]] (1801–1884) suggested in 1833 that patterns among tree rings could be used to synchronize the dendrochronologies of various trees and thereby to reconstruct past climates across entire regions.<ref>Alexander C

Hence, for the entire period of a tree's life, a year-by-year record or ring pattern builds up that reflects the age of the tree and the climatic conditions in which the tree grew
