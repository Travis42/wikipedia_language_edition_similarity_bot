Nevertheless, recent research supports the idea that the lead found in the water came from the supply pipes, rather than another source of contamination.

Jerome Nriagu, a geochemist, argued in a 1983 book that "lead poisoning contributed to the decline of the Roman empire." His work centred on the level to which the [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]], who had few sweeteners besides [[honey]], would boil [[must]] in lead pots to produce a reduced sugar syrup called ''[[defrutum]]'', concentrated again into ''[[sapa (sweetener)|sapa]]''.

Although today lead is no longer seen as the prime culprit of Rome's demise, its status in the system of water distribution by lead pipes (fistulæ) still stands as a major public health issue.

Tainter points out that it can be seen as a very rational preference of individuals at the time, many of whom were better off (all but the elite, presumably.) Archeological evidence from human bones indicates that average nutrition improved after the collapse in many parts of the former Roman Empire. 

27. 
This "Germanization" and the resultant cultural dilution or "barbarization" led not only to a decline in the standard of drill and overall military preparedness within the Empire, but also to a decline of loyalty to the Roman government in favor of loyalty to commanders.

The end of the Western Roman Empire traditionally has been seen by historians to mark the end of the [[Ancient Era]] and beginning of the Middle Ages. 

30. 
The historian [[Arther Ferrill]] has suggested that the Roman Empire – particularly the military – declined largely as a result of an influx of Germanic mercenaries into the ranks of the legions.

Significant events include the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, the death of [[Theodosius I]] in 395 (the last time the Roman Empire was politically unified), the [[crossing of the Rhine]] in 406 by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], the execution of [[Stilicho]] in 408, the [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of Rome]] in 410, the death of [[Constantius III]] in 421, the death of [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]] in 454, and the [[Sack of Rome (455)|second sack of Rome]] in 455, with the death of [[Majorian]] in 461 marking the end of the last opportunity for recovery.

Following these wars, Rome and other Italian cities would fall into severe decline (Rome itself was almost completely abandoned).

* The second war with the Visigoths, led by king [[Alaric I|Alaric]], in which they raided Greece, and then invaded Italy, culminating in the [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of Rome]] (410).

However, the lead content revealed in many other ancient Roman remains have been shown to have been less than half those of modern Europeans,<ref>Drasch 1982:199–231</ref> which have concentrations between 20-50ppm.<ref name="CLUE"/>

=====Criticism of lead poisoning theory=====
The role and importance of lead poisoning in contributing to the fall of the Roman Empire is the subject of controversy, and its importance and validity is discounted by many historians.<ref name="Lessler"/> John Scarborough, a pharmacologist and classicist, criticized Nriagu's book as "so full of false evidence, miscitations, typographical errors, and a blatant flippancy regarding primary sources that the reader cannot trust the basic arguments."<ref>Scarborough, John (1984). 

40. 

Heather then posits what amounts to a domino theory—namely that pressure on peoples very far away from the Empire could result in sufficient pressure on peoples on the Empire's borders to make them contemplate the risk of full scale immigration to the empire. 

41. 

The first invasions disrupted the West to some degree, but it was the [[Gothic War (535–552)|Gothic War]] launched by the Eastern Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] in the 6th century, and meant to reunite the Empire, that eventually caused the most damage to Italy, as well as straining the Eastern Empire militarily. 

42. 
"From the eighteenth century onward," historian [[Glen Bowersock]] wrote, "we have been obsessed with the fall: it has been valued as an archetype for every perceived decline, and, hence, as a symbol for our own fears."<ref>Bowersock, "The Vanishing Paradigm of the Fall of Rome" ''Bulletin of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]'' (1996) 49#8 pp 29-43 at p. 

43. 
Contrary to the trend among some historians of the "there was no fall" school, who view the fall of Rome as not necessarily a "bad thing" for the people involved, Ward-Perkins argues that in many parts of the former Empire the archaeological record indicates that the collapse was truly a disaster.
