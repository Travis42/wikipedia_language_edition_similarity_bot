How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

Chronostratigraphy

en edition's differences with the fa version: 


1. 
For instance, there may be many millions of years between a bed being laid down and an intrusive rock cutting it; the estimate of age must necessarily be between the oldest cross-cutting intrusive rock in the fossil assemblage and the youngest rock upon which the fossil assemblage rests. 

2. 
The aim of chronostratigraphy is to give a meaningful [[geochronology|age date]] to these fossil assemblage intervals and interfaces.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Methodology ==
Chronostratigraphy relies heavily upon [[isotope geology]] and [[geochronology]] to derive hard dating of known and well defined rock units which contain the specific fossil assemblages defined by the stratigraphic system. 

3. 

Because [[igneous]] rocks occur at specific intervals in time and are essentially instantaneous on a geologic time scale, and because they contain mineral assemblages which may be dated more accurately and precisely by isotopic methods, the construction of a chronostratigraphic column relies heavily upon intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks.
