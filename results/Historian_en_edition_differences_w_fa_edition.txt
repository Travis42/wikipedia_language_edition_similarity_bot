#The historian must be even-handed in treatment of evidence and eschew "cherry-picking";
#The historian must clearly indicate any speculation;
#The historian must not mistranslate documents or mislead by omitting parts of documents;
#The historian must weigh the authenticity of all accounts, not merely those that contradict his or her favored view; and
#The historian must take the motives of historical actors into consideration.
