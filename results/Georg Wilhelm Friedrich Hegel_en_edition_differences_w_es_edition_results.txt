According to Hegel, Heraclitus's "obscurity" comes from his being a true (in Hegel's terms "speculative") philosopher who grasped the ultimate philosophical truth and therefore expressed himself in a way that goes beyond the abstract and limited nature of common sense and is difficult to grasp by those who operate within common sense

Furthermore, in Hegel's language the "dialectical" aspect or "moment" of thought and reality, by which things or thoughts turn into their opposites or have their inner contradictions brought to the surface, what he called ''[[Aufheben|Aufhebung]]'', is only preliminary to the "speculative" (and not "synthesizing") aspect or "moment", which grasps the unity of these opposites or contradiction

For example, while it seems to be the case that he felt that a civil society such as the German society in which he lived was an inevitable movement of the dialectic, he made way for the crushing of other types of "lesser" and not fully realized types of civil society as these societies were not fully conscious or aware—as it were—as to the lack of progress in their societies

Hegel's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a philosophy of absolute negation—as long as absolute negation is at the center, systematization remains open, and makes it possible for human beings to become subjects.<ref name="Schroeder2000">{{cite book|author=Steven Schroeder|title=Between Freedom and Necessity: An Essay on the Place of Value|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfT6aQvkVfAC&pg=PA104|accessdate=2012-12-17|year=2000|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-1302-5|page=104}}</ref>

Throughout the 19th century many chairs of philosophy around Europe were held by Hegelians and [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]—among many others—were all deeply influenced by, but also strongly opposed to many of the central themes of Hegel's philosophy

This notion of identity in difference, which is intimately bound up with his conception of contradiction and negativity, is a principal feature differentiating Hegel's thought from that of other philosophers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==== Things-in-themselves ====
For both Hegel and Kant, "we arrive at the concept of the thing in itself by removing, or abstracting from, everything in our experiences of objects of which we can become conscious."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/864849733|title=Understanding Hegel's mature critique of Kant|last=McCumber, John,|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-8047-8853-7|location=Stanford, California|pages=54|oclc=864849733}}</ref> Surprisingly, Hegel faults Kant for not carrying this abstracting procedure far enough; the thing-in-itself is an arbitrary pitstop on the way to ''nothing'', pure indeterminacy: "If we abstract 'Ding' [''thing''] from 'Ding-an-sich' [''thing-in-itself''], we get one of Hegel's standard phrases: 'an sich.' [''in itself'']....A child, in Hegel's example, is thus 'in itself' the adult it will become: to know what a 'child' is means to know that it is, in some respects, a vacancy which will only gain content after it has grown out of childhood."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/864849733|title=Understanding Hegel's mature critique of Kant|last=McCumber, John,|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-8047-8853-7|location=Stanford, California|pages=58|oclc=864849733}}</ref> The thing as it is in itself is indeed knowable: it is the indeterminate, "futural" aspect of the thing we experience––it is what we ''will come to'' know

However, Hegel interprets not-A as not existing at all, not nothing at all, which cannot be conceived, but indeterminate or "pure" [[being]] without [[particular]]ity or specificity.<ref>{{cite book | first=Frederick Charles | last=Copleston | pages=Chapter X | year=2003 | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | isbn=978-0-8264-6901-4 | nopp=true | title=A History of Philosophy: Volume 7: 18th and 19th century German philosophy}}</ref> Pure being and pure non-being or nothingness are for Hegel pure abstractions from the reality of becoming and this is also how he interprets Heraclitus
