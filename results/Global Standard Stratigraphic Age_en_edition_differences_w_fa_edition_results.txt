GSSAs, and the generally more recent and preferred benchmark [[GSSP]]s are defined by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] (ICS) under the auspices of their parent organization, the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] (IUGS), and are used primarily for time dating of rock layers older than 630 [[Megaannum|million years ago]], lacking a good [[fossil record]]

This is because the Earth's crust in geological time scales is constantly being recycled by [[tectonic]] and weathering forces, and older rocks and especially readily accessible exposed [[stratum|strata]] that can act as a time calibration are rare
