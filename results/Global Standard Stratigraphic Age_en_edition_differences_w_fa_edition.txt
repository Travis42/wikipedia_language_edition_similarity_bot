How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

2. 

GSSAs, and the generally more recent and preferred benchmark [[GSSP]]s are defined by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] (ICS) under the auspices of their parent organization, the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] (IUGS), and are used primarily for time dating of rock layers older than 630 [[Megaannum|million years ago]], lacking a good [[fossil record]]. 

3. 
This is because the Earth's crust in geological time scales is constantly being recycled by [[tectonic]] and weathering forces, and older rocks and especially readily accessible exposed [[stratum|strata]] that can act as a time calibration are rare.
