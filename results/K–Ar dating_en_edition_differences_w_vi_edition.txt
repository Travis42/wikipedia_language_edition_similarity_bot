How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

K–Ar dating

en edition's differences with the vi version: 


1. 

The scale factor 0.109 corrects for the unmeasured fraction of {{SimpleNuclide2|potassium|40}} which decayed into {{SimpleNuclide2|calcium|40}}; the sum of the measured {{SimpleNuclide2|potassium|40}} and the scaled amount of {{SimpleNuclide2|argon|40}} gives the amount of {{SimpleNuclide2|potassium|40}} which was present at the beginning of the elapsed time period. 

2. 

==Formula==
The ratio of the amount of {{SimpleNuclide2|argon|40}} to that of {{SimpleNuclide2|potassium|40}} is directly related to the time elapsed since the rock was cool enough to trap the Ar by the equation
:<math chem> t = \frac{t_\frac{1}{2}}{\ln(2)} \ln\left(\frac{\ce{K}_f + \frac{\ce{Ar}_f}{0.109}}{\ce{K}_f}\right)</math>,
where
* ''t'' is time elapsed
* ''t''<sub>1/2</sub> is the [[half-life]] of {{SimpleNuclide2|potassium|40}}
* K<sub>f</sub> is the amount of {{SimpleNuclide2|potassium|40}} remaining in the sample
* Ar<sub>f</sub> is the amount of {{SimpleNuclide2|argon|40}} found in the sample. 

3. 
Time since recrystallization is calculated by measuring the ratio of the amount of {{SimpleNuclide2|argon|40}} accumulated to the amount of {{SimpleNuclide2|potassium|40}} remaining.

In 2013, the K–Ar method was used by the [[Mars Curiosity]] rover to date a rock on the Martian surface, the first time a rock has been dated from its mineral ingredients while situated on another planet.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-356|title=NASA Curiosity: First Mars Age Measurement and Human Exploration Help|publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]|date=2013-12-09}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2013/12/martian-rock-dating-technique-could-point-signs-of-life-space|title=Martian rock-dating technique could point to signs of life in space|date=2013-12-13|publisher=University of Queensland}}</ref>

Conversion to stable {{SimpleNuclide2|calcium|40}} occurs via electron emission ([[beta decay]]) in 89.3% of decay events. 

6. 
Conversion to stable {{SimpleNuclide2|argon|40}} occurs via [[electron capture]] in the remaining 10.7% of decay events.<ref>

Argon, being a [[noble gas]], is a minor component of most rock samples of [[geochronology|geochronological]] interest: it does not bind with other atoms in a crystal lattice. 

7. 
The [[geomagnetic polarity time scale]] was calibrated largely using K–Ar dating.<ref name=McD-H_9>{{harvnb|McDougall|Harrison|1999|p=9}}</ref>

==Decay series==
{{further|Isotopes of potassium}}
Potassium naturally occurs in 3 isotopes: {{SimpleNuclide2|potassium|39}} (93.2581%), {{SimpleNuclide2|potassium|40}} (0.0117%), {{SimpleNuclide2|potassium|41}} (6.7302%). 

8. 

== Assumptions ==
According to {{harvtxt|McDougall|Harrison|1999|p=11}} the following assumptions must be true for computed dates to be accepted as representing the true age of the rock:<ref>{{harvnb|McDougall|Harrison|1999|p=11}}: "As with all isotopic dating methods, there are a number of assumptions that must be fulfilled for a K–Ar age to relate to events in the geological history of the region being studied."</ref>

* The parent nuclide, {{SimpleNuclide|Potassium|40}}, decays at a rate independent of its physical state and is not affected by differences in pressure or temperature. 

9. 
In these materials, the decay product {{SimpleNuclide2|argon|40}} is able to escape the liquid (molten) rock, but starts to accumulate when the rock solidifies ([[Recrystallization (geology)|recrystallizes]]). 

10. 

==Obtaining the data==
To obtain the content ratio of isotopes {{SimpleNuclide2|argon|40}} to {{SimpleNuclide2|potassium|40}} in a rock or mineral, the amount of Ar is measured by [[mass spectrometry]] of the gases released when a rock sample is volatilized in vacuum.
