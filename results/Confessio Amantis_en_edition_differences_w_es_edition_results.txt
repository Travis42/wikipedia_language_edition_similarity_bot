The narrative structure is overlaid on this in three levels: the external matter, the [[frame story|narrative frame]], and the individual tales which make up the bulk of the work

===Narrative frame===
The frame story as such is easily summarised
0.0196173
Mooney  |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>

In genre it is usually considered a poem of consolation, a medieval form inspired by [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' and typified by works such as ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]''

Pearsall (2004:94) assigns a "dubious status" to Macaulay's ‘second recension’ and has other comments on Macaulay's account of the text

The ''Apollonius'' is nearly 2,000 lines long, but at the other extreme, the distinction between tale and allusion is hard to define; for example, summaries of the story of Troilus and Criseide appear in three places (II.2456&ndash;2458, IV.7597&ndash;7602, VIII.2531&ndash;2535), but none can really be described as a "tale"

==Reception==
The ''Confessio'' was apparently popular in its own time; its 49 surviving manuscripts suggest a popularity about halfway between Chaucer's ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' (80 copies) and ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' (16 copies)
0.0353655
A 15th-century treatise printed by [[William Caxton|Caxton]] describes "his bookes, called Confessionalle" as
:''Ful of sentence / set ful fructuosly''
:''That hym to rede / shal gyue you corage''
:''He is so ful of fruyt, sentence and langage''
::<small>(''Book of Curtesye'', 327&ndash;329: Furnivall 1868)</small>
In some cases he is praised and damned at once; [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]] (1640) considers him dangerously attractive, and liable to damage young writers who might be tempted to imitate his style:
<blockquote>''...beware of letting them taste ''Gower'', or ''Chaucer'' at first, lest falling too much in love with Antiquity, and not apprehending the weight, they grow rough and barren in language onely''</blockquote>
[[Russell Peck (scholar)|Peck]] (2000) interprets this as unambiguous praise
0.0392345
This version of the work saw widespread circulation, perhaps due to its royal connections (Peck 2000), and was the most popular of Gower's works, with at least 32 of the 49 surviving manuscripts of the ''Confessio'' containing this version
0.0392345
While only a few manuscripts of this version survive, it has been taken as representing Gower's final vision for the work, and is the best-known version, having served as the basis of all modern editions
0.0392345
According to its prologue, it was composed at the request of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]
0.0392345

== Structure and argument ==
The ''Confessio'' is divided into a prologue and eight books, which are divided thematically
0.0396411

According to Macaulay (1901:xxii), a second recension was issued in about 1392, with some significant changes: most notably, most references to Richard are removed, as is the dedication to Chaucer, and these are replaced with a new dedication to Henry of Lancaster, the future [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]
0.0416145
Even excluding the very shortest, however, there are over 100 individual stories (Macaulay 1908:sec 24), making them more numerous than the strict 100 of the ''[[Decameron]]'', and much more so than the ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' or the ''[[The Legend of Good Women|Legend of Good Women]]''
0.0485503
According to the traditional system, the final sin should be lechery, but since this can hardly be considered a sin against Venus, the topic of the final book is narrowed to the single perversion of incest
0.0490432
It is hard to find works that show signs of direct influence: the only clear example is Shakespeare's ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'', where the influence is conscious borrowing: the use of Gower's characteristic octosyllabic line for the character of Gower himself
0.0490432

In this context, the plan of the work given in the prologue is one of the most-quoted passages of the poem:
:''Bot for men sein, and soth it is,''
:''That who that al of wisdom writ''
:''It dulleth ofte a mannes wit''
:''To him that schal it aldai rede,''
:''For thilke cause, if that ye rede,''
:''I wolde go the middel weie''
:''And wryte a bok betwen the tweie,''
:''Somewhat of lust, somewhat of lore...''
::<small>(prol.12&ndash;19)</small>
This is essentially what he does; the external matter and parts of the narrative frame, together with some long digressions (most notably the whole of Book 7, discussed below) make up the "lore", while the majority of the tales are wholly concerned with "lust"
0.0490432
Lewis]], who, though admitting that the work can be "prosaic" and "dull" in places, identifies a "sweetness and freshness" in the verse and praises its "memorable precision and weight" (Lewis 1936:201)
0.0490432
The influential assessment of [[George Puttenham|Puttenham]] (1589:50) found Gower's English verse inadequate in every respect:
<blockquote>''Gower [...] had nothing in him highly to be commended, for his verse was homely and without good measure, his wordes strained much deale out of the French writers, his ryme wrested, and in his inuentions small subtilitie: the applications of his moralities are the best in him, and yet those many times very grossely bestowed, neither doth the substance of his workes sufficiently aunswere the subtiltie of his titles.''</blockquote>
By the 19th century, the ''Confessio'' was regarded by some as an established "monument of dulness and pedantry" (quoted by Coffman 1945:52)
0.0490432
Lewis, who has been quoted above admiring the style of the work, was unconvinced by its structure, describing the epilogue as "a long and unsuccessful coda" (Lewis 1936:222)
0.0570252

The first known criticism is an apparent reference in Chaucer's '[[The Man of Law's Prologue and Tale|Man of Law's Prologue]]': the eponymous Man, praising Chaucer, observes that
:''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no word ne writeth he''
:''Of thilke wikke ensample of Canacee''
:''That loved hir owene brother synfully&mdash;''
:''Of swiche cursed stories I say fy!&mdash;''
:''Or ellis of Tyro Appollonius,''
:''How that the cursed kyng Antiochus''
:''Birafte his doghter of hir maydenhede,''
:''That is so horrible a tale for to rede''

'''''Confessio Amantis''''' ("The Lover's Confession") is a 33,000-line [[Middle English]] poem by [[John Gower]], which uses the [[Confession (religion)|confession]] made by an ageing lover to the chaplain of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] as a [[frame story]] for a collection of shorter narrative poems
0.0624218
The design is that each book of the poem shall be devoted to one sin, and the first six books follow the traditional order for the first six sins: pride, envy, wrath, sloth, avarice, and gluttony
0.0624218
It has been suggested that it was the influence of Chaucer, who had in part dedicated his ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' to Gower, that persuaded him that the [[vernacular]] was a suitable language for poetry, and the influence of Chaucer's ''[[The Legend of Good Women|Legend of Good Women]]'' has been detected in the ''Confessio'' (Macaulay 1908:sec 23)
0.0736192
The source he relies on most is [[Ovid]], whose ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' was ever a popular source of exempla; others include the Bible and various other classical and medieval writers, of whom Macaulay (1908:sec 29) lists [[Valerius Maximus]], [[Statius]], [[Benoît de Sainte-Maure]] (the ''[[Roman de Troie]]''), [[Guido delle Colonne]] (''[[Historia destructionis Troiae]]''), [[Godfrey of Viterbo]], [[Brunetto Latini]], [[Nicholas Trivet]], the ''[[Seven Wise Masters|Romans des sept sages]]'', the ''Vita Barlaam et Josaphat'', and the ''Historia Alexandri Magni''

At this point, however, Gower breaks his form and digresses: at the end of Book 6 Amans requests that Genius give him a break from the confession and teach him wisdom instead, and Genius responds in Book 7 by discoursing at length on the education given by [[Aristotle]] to [[Alexander the Great]]

The prologue of this first recension recounts that the work was commissioned by [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] after a chance meeting with the [[royal barge]] on the River Thames; the epilogue dedicates the work to Richard and to [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], as the "disciple and poete" of Venus

While not of immense importance as a source for later works, the ''Confessio'' is nonetheless significant in its own right as one of the earliest poems written in a form of English that is clearly recognizable as a direct precursor to the modern standard, and, above all, as one of the handful of works that established the foundations of literary prestige on which modern English literature is built

Composition of the work probably began circa 1386, and the work was completed in 1390

Macaulay (1900: vii) claims that it was the first English book to be translated into a foreign language.Nonetheless, Gower, perhaps more than any poet of his period, has suffered through his close association with Chaucer, who as the preeminent maker of the English Middle Ages overshadows his peers in the same way that Shakespeare dominates the turn of the 17th century
