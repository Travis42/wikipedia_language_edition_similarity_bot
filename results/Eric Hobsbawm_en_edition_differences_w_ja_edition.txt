So what comes next?"/> Until the day of his death, however, he remained firmly entrenched on the Left, maintaining that the long-term outlooks for humanity were 'bleak'.<ref name="Interview with Eric Hobsbawm on his 90th birthday"/><ref name="Eric Hobsbawm: Observer special"/><ref name="Eric Hobsbawm and the working class"/><ref name="The lion of the Left"/><ref name="Diary"/> "I think we ought to get out of that 20th-century habit of thinking of systems as mutually exclusive: you’re either socialist or you’re capitalist, or whatever," Hobsbawm stated in 2009 in regards to the emergence of a new historical system.

that, in the conditions of the 1930s, what Stalin did was a Russian problem, however shocking, whereas what Hitler did was a threat everywhere.<ref name="Hobs_2011 p_268"/>}}

He claimed that the demise of the USSR was "traumatic not only for communists but for socialists everywhere",<ref name="Hobs_2011 p_386"/>

===Miscellaneous views===
Regarding [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]], Hobsbawm stated that constitutional monarchy in general has "proved a reliable framework for liberal-democratic regimes" and "is likely to remain useful".<ref name="Prospect 181"/> On the [[Debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear attacks on Japan]] in World War&nbsp;II, he adhered to the view that "there was even less sign of a crack in Japan's determination to fight to the end [compared with that of Nazi Germany], which is why nuclear arms were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to ensure a rapid Japanese surrender".<ref name="extremes"/> He also believed there was an ancillary political, non-military reason for the bombings: "perhaps the thought that it would prevent America's ally the USSR from establishing a claim to a major part in Japan's defeat was not absent from the minds of the US government either."<ref name="extremes1"/> Hobsbawm is also quoted as saying that, next to sex, there is nothing so physically intense as 'participation in a mass demonstration at a time of great public exaltation'.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Praise and criticism==
In 1994, [[Neal Ascherson]] said of Hobsbawm: "No historian now writing in English can match his overwhelming command of fact and source.

==Academia==
His political affiliation sometimes impacted Hobsbawm's ability to find employment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/01/eric-hobsbawm-history-man|title=Eric Hobsbawm: the history man|last=Mazower|first=Mark|date=2012-10-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-01-17|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> In 1945 he applied to the BBC for a full-time post making educational broadcasts to help servicemen adjust to civilian life after a long period in the forces, but the appointment was swiftly vetoed by [[MI5]].

Of the countries occupied by the Soviet Union after World War&nbsp;II—"the Second World War," he says with characteristic slipperiness, "led communist parties to power" in Eastern and Central Europe—he explains that a "possible critique of the new [postwar] socialist regimes does not concern us here." Why did communist regimes share the characteristics of state terror, oppression and murder.

Hobsbawm joined the ''{{lang|de|Sozialistischer Schülerbund}}'' (Association of Socialist Pupils), an offshoot of the [[Young Communist League of Germany]], in Berlin in 1931,<ref name = "Ascherson 1994"/> and the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|British Communist Party]] in 1936.

In a 1994 interview on BBC British television with [[Canada|Canadian]] author and politician [[Michael Ignatieff]] (whose grandfather and great-grandfather were ministers of the Czar prior to the [[Bolshevik Revolution]]), he shocked viewers when he said that the deaths of millions of Soviet citizens under Stalin would have been worth it if a genuine Communist society had been the result.<ref name="New York Times 1 October 2012"/><ref name="Michael Ignatieff Interview"/><ref name="Times 23 July 2004"/> Hobsbawm argued that, "In a period in which, as you might imagine, mass murder and mass suffering are absolutely universal, the chance of a new world being born in great suffering would still have been worth backing" but, unfortunately, "the Soviet Union was not the beginning of the World Revolution".<ref name="Michael Ignatieff Interview">{{Cite web |title= Michael Ignatieff interviews Eric Hobsbawm |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnd2Pu9NNPw&t=10m57s |date= 24 October 1994 |work=The Late Show |publisher= [[BBC]] |accessdate= 5 June 2013}}<br>The exchange in question occurs at {{YouTube|id=Nnd2Pu9NNPw&t=10m57s|title=10:57}}.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Ghodsee|first=Kristen|date=2017 |title=Red Hangover: Legacies of Twentieth-Century Communism|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/red-hangover|location= |publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|pages=137–138 |isbn=978-0822369493|author-link=Kristen R.

But he did not leave the Party.<ref name = "Ferg review"/>}}Hobsbawm let his membership lapse not long before the party's dissolution in 1991.<ref name="Guardian 14 September 2002"/> In his review of Hobsbawm's memoirs, [[David Pryce-Jones]] accuses him of actually supporting the invasion of Hungary:

{{quote|[H]e carefully makes sure not to quote the letter he published on 9 November 1956 in the Communist ''[[Daily Worker (UK)|Daily Worker]]'' defending the Soviet onslaught on Hungary: "While approving, with a heavy heart, of what is now happening in Hungary, we should therefore also say frankly that we think the USSR should withdraw its troops from the country as soon as this is possible."

== Impact ==
Owing to his status as a widely read and prominent Communist historian, and the fact that his ideology had influenced his work, Hobsbawm has been credited with spreading Marxist thought around the globe.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://aeon.co/essays/how-eric-hobsbawm-helped-shape-the-global-marxist-imagination|title=How Eric Hobsbawm helped shape the global Marxist imagination – Emile Chabal {{!}} Aeon Essays|website=Aeon|language=en|access-date=2019-01-17}}</ref> His writings reached particular prominence in [[India]] and [[Brazil]] in the 1960s and 1970s at a time of lively debate about these countries' political and social future.<ref name=":1" /> Emile Chabal, in an essay for [[Aeon (digital magazine)|Aeon]], writes that "In the period from the early 1960s to the late ’80s, Marxists in noncommunist countries were increasingly able to participate in a transnational discussion over the past and future of capitalism, and the most promising agents of revolutionary change. 

18. 
A third of the 30 reprints of ''Marxism Today''{{'s}} feature articles that appeared in ''The Guardian'' during the 1980s were articles or interviews by or with Hobsbawm, making him by far the most popular of all contributors.<ref name="LLT 56"/>

In addition to his association with the CPGB, Hobsbawm also developed close ties to the largest Communist Party in the western world, the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI), of which he declared himself a "spiritual member". 

19. 
Hobsbawm spoke favourably about PCI general secretary [[Enrico Berlinguer]]'s strategy of [[Historic Compromise]] in the 1970s, seeking rapprochement with the [[Catholic Church in Italy|Catholic Church]] and the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]], providing passive support to the latter in government in order to bring the Communists into the political mainstream by accepting Italy's position as a member of [[NATO]], thus being able to build broader alliances and convince wider sections of society of its legitimacy as a potential governing force.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jacobinmag.com/2018/11/eric-hobsbawm-italy-pci-gramsci |title=Hobsbawm in Italy |last=Broder |first=David |date=18 November 2018 |website=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|access-date=21 November 2018}}</ref>

From the 1960s, his politics took a more moderate turn, as Hobsbawm came to recognise that his hopes were unlikely to be realised, and no longer advocated "socialist systems of the Soviet type".<ref name="Socialism has failed.

That year the family moved to London, where Hobsbawm enrolled in [[St&nbsp;Marylebone Grammar School]] (now defunct).<ref name="Guardian 14 September 2002"/>

25. 
While attacking Hobsbawm for his communist sympathies and his purported views about Israel, Walther wrote that "There is no denying his [Hobsbawm's] intelligence and erudition" and concluded that "if Hobsbawm is read 50 or 100 years from now, it will probably be despite rather than because of his politics."<ref name="Walther 27–28">{{cite magazine |last=Walther |first=Matthew |title=Eric the Red |magazine=National Review |date=25 November 2013 |pages=27–28 |url=https://www.nationalreview.com/nrd/articles/363356/eric-red}}</ref>

David Evanier, in an article published in the American [[neoconservative]] magazine ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', called Hobsbawm "Stalin's cheerleader", writing: "One can learn almost nothing about the history of communism from Hobsbawm's ''Interesting Times''—nothing about the show trials, the torture and execution of millions, the Communist betrayal of Spain."<ref name="WeekStan 19 May 2003"/>

An alternative conservative assessment of Hobsbawm came from Matthew Walther in ''[[National Review]]''.

He signed a historians' letter of protest against the Soviet invasion of Hungary and was strongly in favour of the [[Prague spring]].<ref name="Guardian 14 September 2002"/>

Hobsbawm was later a leading light of the [[Eurocommunism|Eurocommunist]] faction in the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|CPGB]] that began to gather strength after 1968, when the CPGB criticised the Soviet crushing of the [[Prague Spring]] and the [[French Communist Party|French CP]] failing to support the [[May 1968 in France|May students]] in Paris.<ref name = "LLT 56"/> In "The Forward March of Labour Halted?" (originally a Marx Memorial Lecture, "The British Working Class One Hundred Years after Marx", that was delivered to a small audience of fellow Marxists in March 1978 before being published in ''[[Marxism Today]]'' in September 1978), he argued that the working class was inevitably losing its central role in society, and that left-wing parties could no longer appeal only to this class; a controversial viewpoint in a period of trade union militancy.<ref name = "LLT 56"/><ref name="The Forward March of Labour Halted?"/> Hobsbawm supported [[Neil Kinnock]]'s transformation of the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] from 1983 (the party received just 28 per cent of the vote in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|that year's elections]], just 2 per cent more than the Social Democratic Party/Liberal Alliance), and, though not close to Kinnock, came to be referred to as "Neil Kinnock's Favourite Marxist".<ref name = "LLT 56"/> His interventions in Kinnock's remaking of the Labour Party helped prepare the ground for the [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]], [[New Labour]], and [[Tony Blair]],<ref name = "LLT 56"/> whom Hobsbawm later derisively referred to as "Thatcher in trousers".<ref name="Man of the extreme century"/> Until the cessation of publication in 1991, he contributed to the magazine ''Marxism Today''.

British historian [[David Pryce-Jones]] conceded that Hobsbawm was "no doubt intelligent and industrious, and he might well have made a notable contribution as a historian", but also charged that Hobsbawm, as a professional historian who has "steadily corrupted knowledge into propaganda, and scorns the concept of objective truth", was "neither a historian nor professional."<ref name="DPJ Jan2003"/> After reading ''Age of Extremes'', Kremlinologist [[Robert Conquest]] concluded that Hobsbawm suffers from a "massive reality denial" regarding the USSR,<ref name="WSJ 20 August 2011"/> and [[John N.

As a [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historiographer]] he has focused on analysis of the "[[dual revolution]]" (the political [[French Revolution]] and the British [[Industrial Revolution]]). 

54. 
Nothing else produced by the British Marxist historians will endure as these books will."<ref name="Ferg review"/> In 2003, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described him as "one of the great British historians of his age, an unapologetic Communist and a polymath whose erudite, elegantly written histories are still widely read in schools here and abroad".<ref name="WSJ 20 August 2011"/> [[James Joll]] wrote in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' that "Eric Hobsbawm's nineteenth century trilogy is one of the great achievements of historical writing in recent decades".<ref name="extremes2"/> [[Ian Kershaw]] said that Hobsbawm's take on the twentieth century, his 1994 book, ''[[The Age of Extremes]]'', consisted of "masterly analysis".{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=597, note 1}} Meanwhile, [[Tony Judt]], while praising Hobsbawm's vast knowledge and graceful prose, cautioned that Hobsbawm's bias in favour of the [[USSR]], [[communist state]]s and communism in general, and his tendency to disparage any nationalist movement as passing and irrational, weakened his grasp of parts of the 20th century.<ref name="NYRB"/>

With regard to the impact of his Marxist outlook and sympathies on his scholarship, [[Ben Pimlott]] saw it as "a tool not a straitjacket; he's not dialectical or following a party line", although Judt argued that it has "prevented his achieving the analytical distance he does on the 19th century: he isn't as interesting on the Russian revolution because he can't free himself completely from the optimistic vision of earlier years. 

55. 
In 2003 he received the [[Balzan Prize]] for [[European History]] since 1900 "for his brilliant analysis of the troubled history of 20th century Europe and for his ability to combine in-depth historical research with great literary talent."
