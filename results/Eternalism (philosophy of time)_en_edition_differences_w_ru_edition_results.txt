However, there are events that may be non-simultaneous in all frames of reference: when one event is within the [[light cone]] of another—its causal past or causal future—then observers in all frames of reference show that one event preceded the other

Both ends of the bar pass through the ring simultaneously in the rest frame of the ring (left), but the ends of the bar pass one after the other in the rest frame of the bar (right).]]
[[Special relativity]] eliminates the concept of absolute [[simultaneity]] and a universal present: according to the [[relativity of simultaneity]], observers in different [[Frame of reference|frames of reference]] can have different measurements of whether a given pair of events happened at the same time or at different times, with there being no physical basis for preferring one frame's judgments over another's

Elitzur and Dolev believe that an objective passage of time and relativity can be reconciled, and that it would resolve many of the issues with the block universe and the conflict between relativity and quantum mechanics.<ref>Elitzur, A

=== Quantum physics ===
Some philosophers appeal to a specific theory that is "timeless" in a more radical sense than the rest of physics, the theory of [[quantum gravity]]

As time passes, the moment that was once the present becomes part of the past; and part of the future, in turn, becomes the new present

==The present==

In classical philosophy, time is divided into three distinct regions; the "[[past]]", the "[[present]]", and the "[[future]]"
0.214825
McTaggart argued that the description of events as existing in absolute time is self-contradictory, because the events have to have properties about being in the past and in the future, which are incompatible with each other
0.272662
The causal past and causal future are consistent within all frames of reference, but any other time is "elsewhere", and within it there is no present, past, or future
