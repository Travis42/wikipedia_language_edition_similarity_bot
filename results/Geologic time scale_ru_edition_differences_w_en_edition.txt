How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

In honor of the ancient tribes, they are named after the ancient tribes of the "Wends" (the German name for the Slavic people of the Puddle Serbs), the Ordovician period, and the "silir" (The tribes of the Celts) and the "Siluras of the Power" periods.

At the end of the Miocene there were several cycles of partial or almost complete drying of the Mediterranean Sea.

The formation of the Gondwana and two continents collided, resulting in the formation of the "Pangaea" and the "Appalachian Mountains".

9. 
The coal age is named because of the large number of coal seams, and the cretaceous period is named because of the widespread spread of chalk. 

10. 
The maximum age of the Earth is limited by the age of the earliest solid formations in the Solar System, which are rich in "calcium" and "aluminium" (CAI) from the snares of chondrites.

Geochronological scale
The "Geochronology Scale" is a "geological scale" used in geology and paleontology, a kind of "calendar" for periods of hundreds of thousands and millions of years. 

15. 

The principle of building a scale
The geochronological scale was created to determine the relative geological age of the rocks.
