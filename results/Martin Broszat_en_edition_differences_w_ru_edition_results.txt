===="Wo sich die Geister scheiden" (1986)====
The ''[[Historikerstreit]]'' ("historians' dispute") of 1986–1988 was triggered by an article the German historian [[Ernst Nolte]] wrote for the conservative newspaper ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' in June 1986: "The past that will not pass"

Broszat did accept that there was no evidence of a written order from Hitler to enact the "[[Final Solution to the Jewish Question]]".<ref>Kershaw 1990, 313.</ref> When faced with the stalemate on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], the overwhelming of the European rail system by successive deportations of Jews to Poland, and the self-imposed "problem" of the three million Polish Jews the Germans had forced into ghettos, German officials in Poland had embarked on improvised killing schemes on their own initiative, he argued

===Broszat–Wulf letters (1963)===
{{anchor|letters}}When the German-Jewish historian [[Joseph Wulf]] accused a prominent German doctor, Wilhelm Hagen, a senior official in the West German Ministry of Health, of having helped to liquidate Jews in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], Broszat and other experts from the Institut für Zeitgeschichte tried to silence him during an exchange of letters in 1963

{{ISBN|0-8070-4302-8}}</ref> Broszat used as an example the wide-ranging reform of the German [[social insurance]] system proposed in 1940 by the [[German Labour Front|DAF]], which he argued was in many ways the forerunner of the West German social insurance plan of 1957, with such features as pensions guaranteed by the state indexed to the level of GNP (which was not surprising given that many of the same people worked on both plans).<ref name="Broszat pages 77–87">Broszat, Martin (1990)

Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 126 (125–129).</ref> He was particularly critical of an earlier claim of Nolte's that [[Chaim Weizmann]], president of the [[World Zionist Organization]] during World War II, had effectively declared war on Germany in 1939, on behalf of world Jewry.<ref>Broszat 1993, 126.</ref> Broszat wrote that Weizmann's letter to [[Neville Chamberlain]] promising the support of the Jewish Agency against Hitler was not a "declaration of war", nor did Weizmann have the legal power to declare war on anyone: "These facts may be overlooked by a right-wing publicist with a dubious educational background but not by the college professor Ernst Nolte."<ref>Broszat 1993, 126–127.</ref> He argued that [[Andreas Hillgruber]] had come close to being a Nazi apologist and that Nolte's arguments had, indeed (without any intention on his part), turned into apologetics.<ref>Broszat 1993, 126–127.</ref> He ended his essay by arguing that, to ensure the German people a better future, they should not be persuaded to become less critical of their past.<ref>Broszat 1993, 129.</ref>

====Debate with Saul Friedländer====
Broszat's call for the "historicization" of the Nazi era involved him in a vigorous debate with three Israeli historians in the latter half of the 1980s: Otto Dov Kulka, Dan Diner, and above all the Franco-Israeli historian [[Saul Friedländer]].<ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/> The debate between Broszat and Friedländer was conducted through a series of letters between 1987 until Broszat's death in 1989.<ref name=BroszatFried/> In 1990 the Broszat-Friedländer correspondence was translated into English and published in ''Reworking the Past: Hitler, The Holocaust and the Historians' Debate'', edited by [[Peter Baldwin (professor)|Peter Baldwin]].<!-- Broszat's position was highly questionable, inasmuch as it refuted the legitimacy of Jewish historiography
0.123325
In his view, these were a cloak for the essence of National Socialism: an intense desire to realize the "rebirth" of "the German nation", and irrational hatred of those considered ''Volksfeinde'' (enemies of the German people) and ''Volksfremde'' (those foreign to the German "race")
0.125868
Broszat accepted Wulf's version of events only after Wulf produced a war-time memo written by Hagen urging that sick Jews "wandering around" be shot down.<ref name="Kershaw 2004"/>

===Auschwitz trials; ''Anatomie des SS-Staates'' (1965)===
{{main|Frankfurt Auschwitz trials|Auschwitz concentration camp}}
At the 1963–1965 [[Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials]], in which 20 of those involved with Auschwitz were prosecuted, Broszat and two other researchers from the Institut für Zeitgeschichte—[[Helmut Krausnick]] and Hans Buchheim—served as expert witnesses for the prosecution

The historian [[Norbert Frei]] writes that making a false statement would have been risky; he concludes that Broszat probably did not know that a membership card had been issued in his name.{{sfn|Frei|2003|loc=3}}

==Early career==
===Institut für Zeitgeschichte===
After university, Broszat worked with [[Theodor Schieder]] on the eight-volume ''Dokumentation der Vertreibung der Deutschen aus Ost-Mitteleuropa'' (1954–1957), and in 1955 he joined the Institut für Zeitgeschichte in Munich.<ref name=Kershaw1990p310>Kershaw, Ian (1990)

Trove, National Library of Australia.</ref>

===Party membership===
As a teenager, Broszat joined the [[Hitler Youth]] in Großdeuben (now part of [[Böhlen]]), and in 1944 a membership card for the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP, the ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'' or National Socialist German Workers' Party) was issued for him
0.184988
Second, he explored the structure of the Nazi German state, which led to his book ''Der Staat Hitlers'' (1969), published in English as ''The Hitler State'' (1981)
0.185125
Broszat used the ''Resistenz'' concept to advance the view that at the local level, there was much continuity in Germany between the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] and Nazi eras.<ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/>

==Historicization of Nazi Germany{{anchor|historicization}}==
==="A Plea for a Historicization of National Socialism" (1985)===
In "A Plea for a Historicization of National Socialism", an essay published in ''Merkur'' in May 1985, Broszat argued that historians should approach Nazi Germany as they would any other period of history, without moralizing.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Broszat |first1=Martin |title=Plädoyer für eine Historisierung des Nationalsozialismus |journal=Merkur |date=1 May 1985 |volume=435 |url=https://www.ifz-muenchen.de |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504022249/https://www.merkur-zeitschrift.de/1985/05/01/plaedoyer-fuer-eine-historisierung-des-nationalsozialismus/ |archive-date=4 May 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Kershaw 1990, 314.</ref><ref name=BroszatFried/> Recommending an ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' approach that would allow shades of gray by examining both the normality of everyday life and the barbarity of the regime,<ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 221">Kershaw, Ian (2000) [1985]

The argument is that, although Hitler did not involve himself much in daily administration, this stemmed not from an inability to do so (as Broszat suggested), but from a lack of interest in the quotidian.<ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/> 

==="Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution'" (1977)===
====Hitler's involvement====
In his essay "Hitler und die Genesis der 'Endlösung': Aus Anlaß der Thesen von David Irving" (1977), Broszat criticized the English author [[David Irving]]'s argument in the latter's ''[[Hitler's War]]'' (1977) that Hitler had wanted to expel the Jews and make Europe ''judenfrei'' ("free of Jews") but had not known about the Holocaust until autumn 1943

====Criticism of David Irving====
In the same essay, Broszat was extremely critical of Irving's handling of sources, accusing him of repeatedly seeking to distort the historical record in Hitler's favour.<ref>Broszat 1985, 392–395, 413–423.</ref> He complained that Irving focused too much on military events at the expense of the broader political context, and that he accepted Nazi claims at face value, such as accepting the claim that the [[Action T4]] "euthanasia" program of the "incurably sick" began in September 1939 to free up hospital space for wounded German soldiers, when in fact it began in January 1939.<ref>Broszat 1985, 394.</ref> Broszat criticized Irving's claim that one telephone note written by Himmler stating "No liquidation" with regard to a train convoy in November 1941 of German Jews passing through [[Berlin]] to [[Riga]] (whom the SS intended to have shot on arrival) was proof that Hitler did not want the Holocaust
0.221063
With [[Hans Mommsen]], Broszat developed a "structuralist" or "functionalist" interpretation of Nazi Germany, arguing in his 1969 book ''Der Staat Hitlers'' (''The Hitler State'') that the government had consisted of a welter of competing institutions and power struggles, and that this internal rivalry, not [[Adolf Hitler]], had been the driving force behind the regime.<ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/> In Broszat's view, Hitler had been a "weak dictator" (to use Mommsen's phrase) and the [[government of Nazi Germany]] a ''polycracy'' (rule by many), not a ''monocracy'' (rule by one).<ref name="Lorenz pages 143–144"/> It was the chaos of the government that led to the collapse of the state and what Kersaw called the "accelerating progression into barbarism".<ref>Kershaw 1990, 312.</ref> Broszat wrote:

{{quote|Because of the multiplicity of conflicting forces the Fuhrer's will (even when Hitler had something different in mind) was ultimately only able to influence events in this or that direction in an uncoordinated and abrupt fashion, and it was certainly not in a position to watch over and curb the new organizations, authorities and ambitions which developed as a result
0.241123
Broszat argued that the "No liquidation" comment referred only to that train and was probably related to concerns that American reporters had been asking about the fate of German Jews deported to Eastern Europe.<ref>Broszat 1985, 413–415.</ref>

Broszat criticized Irving for accepting the "fantastic" claims of the SS ''[[Obergruppenführer]]'' [[Karl Wolff]] that he did not know about the Holocaust (Irving's argument was that if Wolff did not know about it, how could Hitler?), despite the fact that Wolff was convicted of war crimes in 1963 on the basis of documentary evidence implicating him in the Holocaust.<ref>Broszat 1985, 420–421.</ref> Broszat also accused Irving of seeking to generate a highly misleading impression of a conference between Hitler and the Hungarian Regent, Admiral [[Miklós Horthy]], in April 1943 by re-arranging the words to make Hitler appear less brutally antisemitic than the original notes showed.<ref>Broszat 1985, 427–428.</ref>
