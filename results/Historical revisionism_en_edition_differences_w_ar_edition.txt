The old consensus, based upon limited evidence, might no longer be considered historically valid in explaining the particulars – of cause and effect, of motivation and self-interest – that tell ''How?'' and ''Why?'' the past occurred as it occurred; therefore, the historical revisionism of the factual record is revised to concord with the contemporary understanding of history.

The unending quest of historians for understanding the past – that is, ''revisionism'' – is what makes history vital and meaningful.

In 1976 after the archive were opened [[Brian Randell]] wrote in ''The COLOSSUS'' on page 87 that: "the COLOSSUS project was an important source of this vitality, one that has been largely unappreciated, as has the significance of its places in the chronology of the invention of the digital computer."</ref>

*'''Historical causation:''' Issues of [[causality|causation]] in history are often revised with new research: for example by the middle of the twentieth century the status quo was to see the [[French Revolution]] as the result of the triumphant rise of a new middle class.

This revisionism is then challenged by the supporters of the previous view, often in heated terms, and becomes an illegitimate form of historical revisionism known as [[historical negationism]] if it involves inappropriate methods such as the use of forged documents or implausible distrust of genuine documents, attributing false conclusions to books and sources, manipulating statistical data and deliberately mis-translating texts. 

38. 

As such, Lipstadt, Shermer, and Grobman said that legitimate historical revisionism entails the refinement of existing knowledge about a historical event, not a denial of the event, itself; that such refinement of history emerges from the examination of new, empirical evidence, and a re-examination, and consequent re-interpretation of the existing documentary evidence.

The military leadership of the [[British Army]] during [[World War I]] was frequently condemned as poor by historians and politicians for decades after the war ended.

Revisionist history is often practiced by those who are in the minority, such as feminist historians, ethnic minority historians, those working outside of mainstream academia in smaller and less known universities, or the youngest scholars, essentially historians who have the most to gain and the least to lose in challenging the status quo. 

41. 
In the words of [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]], "the Civil War was a class war." In the post [[World War II]] years the influence of Marxist interpretation waned in British academia and by the 1970s this view came under attack by a new school of revisionists and it has been largely overturned as a major mainstream explanation of the middle 17th century conflict in [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]].

That legitimate historical revisionism acknowledges the existence of a "certain body of irrefutable evidence" and the existence of a "convergence of evidence", which suggest that an event – such as the [[Black Death]], [[Slavery in the United States|American slavery]], and [[the Holocaust]] – did occur; whereas the denialism of history rejects the entire foundation of historical evidence, which is a form of historical negationism.<ref>Lipstadt 1993:21; Shermer & Grobman 200:34</ref><ref>Ronald J.

==Negationism and denial==
{{main|Historical negationism}}

The historian [[Deborah Lipstadt]] (''[[Denying the Holocaust]]: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory'', 1993), and the historians [[Michael Shermer]] and [[Alex Grobman]] (''[[Denying History]]: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?'', 2002), distinguish between historical revisionism and historical negationism, the latter of which is a form of [[denialism]].

Without revisionist historians, who have done research in new sources and asked new and nuanced questions, we would remain mired in one or another of these stereotypes.

In contrast to the single-paradigm form of writing history, the philosopher of science, [[Thomas Kuhn]], said, in contrast to the quantifiable [[hard sciences]], characterized by a single paradigm, the [[social sciences]] are characterized by several paradigms that derive from a "tradition of claims, counterclaims, and debates over [the] fundamentals" of research.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas N.|authorlink=Thomas Kuhn|editor1-last=Lakatos|editor1-first=Imre|editor2-last=Musgrave|editor2-first=Alan|editor1-link=Imre Lakatos|editor2-link=Alan Musgrave|title=Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge|edition=second|origyear=1970|year=1972|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-09623-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/criticismgrowth00laka/page/6 6]|chapter=Logic of Discovery or Psychology of Research|url=https://archive.org/details/criticismgrowth00laka/page/6}}</ref> About resistance against the works of revised history that present a [[Postcolonialism|culturally comprehensive]] historical narrative of the U.S.

* '''Culture:''' For example, as regionalism has regained some of its old prominence in British politics, some historians have been suggesting that the older studies of the [[English Civil War]] are too England-centered and that to understand the war, events that had previously been dismissed as on the periphery should be given greater prominence.

====German guilt====
In reaction to the orthodox interpretation enshrined in the [[Versailles Treaty]] (which declared that Germany was guilty of starting World War I), the self-described "revisionist" historians of the 1920s rejected the orthodox view and presented a complex causation in which several other countries were equally guilty.
