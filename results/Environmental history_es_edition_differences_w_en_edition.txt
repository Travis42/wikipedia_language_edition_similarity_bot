How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

This discipline integrates elements of [[agrarian history], in the way that the [Annales School] used the French-oriented [[human geography]] of [Vidal de la Blache]: [[Fernand Braudel] and his famous work ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Time of Philip II'', which begins with what can be considered an ecohistory of the [[Mediterranean Basin]] under its long-term concept ''La terre et la evolution humaine'' by [[Lucien Febvre]]; or the ''French rural history'' by [[Marc Bloch]].
