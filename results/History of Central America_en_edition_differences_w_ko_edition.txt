History of Central America

en edition's differences with the ko version: 


1. 
It was a political movement that strived to unify the regions of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Guatemala (Panama and Belize at the time were under separate ownership) under a liberal federal government and believed that united they would be a stronger political unit. 

2. 
Unfortunately, due to many strong political disagreements within the different states, the UPCA eventually disbanded and the regions became separate nations with devastating political and economic civil wars that are still felt today. 

3. 
However, the UPCA soon noticed that there were many political ideals between the regions and conservative parties on the other end of the political spectrum actively showed their discontent under the new liberal regime. 

4. 
The exception was the [[Western Caribbean Zone]], which included the Caribbean coast and encompassed both semi-independent indigenous polities, runaway slave communities, and settlers, especially British settlers who would eventually form  [[British Honduras]] (the modern-day nation of [[Belize]]), a sparsely populated area that was inhabited by the British through the Treaty of Madrid from Spain. 

5. 
British Honduras, as the British called it, and Belize as the Spaniards and Guatemalans said, gained its independence from Great Britain in 1981 and adopted the name "Belize". 

6. 
When Spain failed to regain control over British Honduras, the British continued to inhabit the country and eventually colonized it. 

7. 
British Honduras had been a British settlement, not a colony (the treaty between Spain and The United Kingdom prohibited British colonies in the territory) for several years.
