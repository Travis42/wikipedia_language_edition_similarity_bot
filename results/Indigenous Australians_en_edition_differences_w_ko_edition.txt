Evidence of Aboriginal art can be traced back at least 30,000 years,{{sfn|Culture Portal|2007}} with examples of ancient rock art throughout the continent. 

10. 

Since the 1970s, Indigenous artists have employed the use of acrylic paints – with styles such as that of the [[Western Desert Art Movement]] becoming globally renowned 20th-century art movements. 

11. 
David Ross of the Central Land Council was sceptical, saying "it's a new skin for an old snake",<ref>(ABC Television News 12 October 2007)</ref>
while former Chairman of the Reconciliation Council [[Patrick Dodson]] gave qualified support, saying: "I think it's a positive contribution to the process of national reconciliation...It's obviously got to be well discussed and considered and weighed, and it's got to be about meaningful and proper negotiations that can lead to the achievement of constitutional reconciliation."<ref>(ABC radio 12 October 2007)</ref>
The [[Gillard Government]], with bi-partisan support, convened an expert panel to consider changes to the [[Australian Constitution]] that would see recognition for Indigenous Australians. 

12. 
First Nations is considered the most acceptable by most people.{{sfn|Common Ground}}

Being as specific as possible, for example naming the [[Australian Aboriginal languages|language group]] (such as [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]]), [[demonym]] relating to geographic area (such as [[Nunga]]), is considered best practice and most respectful. 

13. 
Journalist [[Stan Grant (journalist)|Stan Grant]] has written several non-fiction works on what it means to be Aboriginal in contemporary Australia, and [[Bruce Pascoe]] has written both fiction and non-fiction works. 

14. 
The ALP initially supported the idea, however [[Kevin Rudd]] withdrew this support just before the election – earning stern rebuke from activist [[Noel Pearson]].{{sfn|''The Australian''|2007}} Critical sections of the Australian public and media{{sfn|Matthews|2007}} meanwhile suggested that Howard's raising of the issue was a "cynical" attempt in the lead-up to an election to "whitewash" his handling of this issue during his term in office. 

15. 
Indigenous Australia's [[oral tradition]] and religious values are based upon reverence for the land and a belief in this Dreamtime.{{sfn|Andrews|2004|p=424}} The Dreaming is at once both the ancient time of creation and the present-day reality of Dreaming. 

16. 
The eastern Torres Strait Islanders in particular are related to the Papuan peoples of [[New Guinea]], and speak a [[Papuan language]].{{sfn|Ethnologue.com}} Accordingly, they are not generally included under the designation "Aboriginal Australians". 

17. 
Researchers at the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]] under [[Lyndall Ryan]] have been mapping the massacres.{{sfn|University of Newcastle|2017b}} {{as of|lc=yes|2020}} they have mapped almost 500 places where massacres happened, with 12,361 Aboriginal people killed and 204 Colonists killed,{{sfn|UoN}} numbering at least 311 massacres over a period of about 140 years. 

18. 
This is evidence of a clear issue occurring not only within Australia's criminal justice system, but within communities as a whole.{{sfn|AIHW Youth Justice|2018}}

Explanations for this overrepresentation link back to the effect systemic racism has on the individual and the community. 

19. 
A number of government initiatives have resulted, some of which are listed at the Commonwealth Government's website.{{sfn|DEEWR}}

The [[Aboriginal Centre for the Performing Arts]] was established as a training centre by the State and Federal Governments in 1997. 

20. 

The 2007 National Drug Strategy Household Survey{{sfn|AIoHW|2008}} reported that Indigenous peoples were "more likely than other Australians to abstain from alcohol consumption (23.4% versus 16.8%) and also more likely to consume alcohol at risky or high-risk levels for harm in the short term (27.4% versus 20.1%)". 

21. 
As of the 2018 Close the Gap report,{{sfn|IAA|2018}} the Aboriginal employment rate had decreased from 48% in 2006 to 46.6% in 2016, while the non-Aboriginal employment rate remained steady at around 72%, making for a 25.4% gap between the two populations. 

22. 
Those with a degree have an employment probability of 85% (for males) and 74% (for females) for gaining employment.{{sfn|Biddle|Hunter|Yap|Gray}} These statistics decrease depending on qualifications so that those who have completed Year 9 and below have a 43% (male) and 32% (female) probability of gaining employment.{{sfn|Biddle|Hunter|Yap|Gray}} However, other factors do contribute to low employment and these, unlike education, are not covered by current government policy, such as discrimination and unfair treatment. 

23. 

The broad term Aboriginal Australians includes many regional groups that may be identified under names based on local language, locality, or what they are called by neighbouring groups. 

24. 
A representative body, the [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]] (ATSIC), was set up in 1990.{{sfn|Pratt|2003}}

====Reconciliation====
Reconciliation between non-Indigenous and Indigenous Australians became a significant issue in Australian politics in the late 20th century. 

25. 
In 1991, the [[Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation]] was established by the federal government to facilitate reconciliation. 

26. 
A year later, the [[Aboriginal Tent Embassy]] was established on the steps of [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in [[Canberra]]. 

27. 
The term "Aborigine" is deprecated, being regarded as outdated and inappropriate, having connotations of [[colonial Australia]].{{sfn|Common Ground}}{{sfn|Appropriate words & terminology}}

While the term "Indigenous Australians" has grown since the 1980s,{{sfn|Flinders University|1996}} many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples dislike it, feeling that it is too generic and removes their identity. 

28. 
[[Hip hop]] music is helping preserve indigenous languages.{{sfn|''The Age''|2006}}

The [[Aboriginal Centre for the Performing Arts]] in [[Brisbane]] teaches acting, music and dance, and the [[Bangarra Dance Theatre]] is an acclaimed contemporary dance company. 

29. 
In 2007, [[Kava]] was banned in the Northern Territory.{{sfn|ABC News – Kava Ban|2007}}

[[Petrol sniffing in Australia|Petrol sniffing]] is also a problem among some remote Indigenous communities.

| 11% incidence of [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] in Indigenous Australians, 3% in non-Indigenous population. 

31. 

Some communities (particularly in the Northern Territory) introduced [[kava]] as a safer alternative to alcohol, as over-indulgence in kava produces sleepiness, in contrast to the violence that can result from over-indulgence in alcohol. 

32. 

The ''[[Uluru Statement from the Heart]]''{{sfn|Uluru Statement from the Heart}} was released 26 May 2017 by delegates to an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Referendum Convention, held near [[Uluru]] in Central Australia. 

33. 
After the end of the war he applied for a passport but was rejected as he was an Aborigine, he obtained an exemption under the Aborigines Protection Act but was now told he could no longer visit his relatives as he was not an Aborigine. 

34. 
Perkins|Charles Perkins]]' involvement in the [[Freedom Ride (Australia)|Freedom Ride]] of 1965 and subsequent work; or Torres Strait Islander [[Eddie Mabo]]'s part in the landmark [[native title]] decision that bears his name. 

35. 
In the north, stretching from the Western [[Kimberley region of Western Australia|Kimberley]] to the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], are found a number of non-Pama–Nyungan groups of languages which have not been shown to be related to the Pama–Nyungan family nor to each other.{{sfn|Evans|2003}} While it has sometimes proven difficult to work out familial relationships within the Pama–Nyungan language family, many Australian linguists feel there has been substantial success.{{sfn|Bowern|Harold|2004}} Against this, some linguists, such as [[R. 

36. 
The 2012 Territory election saw large swings to the conservative [[Country Liberal Party]] achieved in remote Territory electorates and a total of five Aboriginal CLP candidates won election to the Assembly (along with one Labor candidate) in a chamber of 25 members. 

37. 

=== Life expectancy ===
{{also|Indigenous health in Australia}}

The life expectancy of Indigenous Australians is difficult to quantify accurately. 

38. 
Within Aboriginal belief systems, a formative epoch known as "the [[Dreamtime]]" or "the Dreaming" stretches back into the distant past when the creator ancestors known as the First Peoples travelled across the land, and naming as they went. 

39. 
The ABS has published a report exploring the reasons for these findings, with some of the factors behind the increase listed as:{{sfn|ABS increase|2018}}
* The fertility rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, which have traditionally been higher than other Australian women. 

40. 
Such ochres were also used to paint their bodies for ceremonial purposes.{{sfn|Rurenga|2017}}{{sfn|Aboriginal Art Online|2008}}

Several styles of Aboriginal art have developed in modern times, including the [[watercolour]] paintings of the [[Hermannsburg School]] and the acrylic [[Papunya Tula]] "dot art" movement. 

41. 

It was not until the repeal of Section 127 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] in 1967 that Indigenous Australians were counted in the population for the purposes of distribution of electoral seats. 

42. 
The study, Ampe Akelyernemane Meke Mekarle "Little Children are Sacred", suggested that children in Aboriginal communities were being widely exposed to inappropriate sexual activity such as pornography, adult films and adults having sex within their view. 

43. 
In addition, there is a significant lack of consultation with Aboriginal peoples on the methods they think best to tackle issues like unemployment.{{sfn|Biddle|Hunter|Yap|Gray}}

=== Health ===
{{Further|Indigenous health in Australia}}

Indigenous Australians were twice as likely to report their health as fair/poor and 1.5 times more likely to have a disability or long-term health condition (after adjusting for demographic structures).{{sfn|ABoS|2005a}}

Health problems with the highest disparity (compared with the non-Indigenous population) in incidence{{sfn|AIoHW|2003}} are outlined in the table below:

44. 
In general, the gaps have improved – as with an improvement of NAPLAN results – or not devolved – as with the attendance rate remaining stable for several years – but unfortunately not to the standard required.{{sfn|OPMC Closing the Gap}} Remoteness does appear to be a factor, as students in remote areas do not perform or attend as well as students in urban areas.{{sfn|OPMC Closing the Gap}}

In response to this problem, the Commonwealth Government formulated a [[National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy]]. 

45. 
The first part – descent – was genetic descent and unambiguous, but led to cases where a lack of records to prove ancestry excluded some. 

46. 

The third series of the [[sketch comedy]] TV series ''[[Black Comedy (TV series)|Black Comedy]]'', co-written by [[Nakkiah Lui]], [[Adam Briggs]], [[Steven Oliver (Australian actor)|Steven Oliver]] and others, and featuring many Indigenous actors, goes to air in January 2020.{{sfn|Black Comedy}}

== Recreation and sport ==
[[File:Marn grook illustration 1857.jpg|thumb|1857 depiction of the [[Jarijari]] (Nyeri Nyeri) people near [[Merbein, Victoria|Merbein]] engaged in recreational activities, including a type of Aboriginal football.{{sfn|Blandowski|1862}}{{sfn|WDL – Blandowski|1862}}{{sfn|Hilferti|2010|p=79}} ]]
[[File:Aboriginal cricket team Tom Wills 1866.jpg|thumb|Aboriginal cricket team with [[Tom Wills]] (coach and captain), [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], December 1866]]
Though lost to history, many traditional forms of recreation were played and while these varied from tribe to tribe, there were often similarities. 

47. 

The canon of films related to Indigenous Australians increased from the 1990s, with [[Nick Parson]]'s film ''[[Dead Heart (film)|Dead Heart]]'' (1996) featuring [[Ernie Dingo]] and [[Bryan Brown]];{{sfn|ASO – Dead Heart}} [[Rolf de Heer]]'s ''[[The Tracker (2002 film)|The Tracker]]'' (2002), starring [[Gary Sweet]] and David Gulpilil;{{sfn|ASO – The Tracker}} and [[Phillip Noyce]]'s ''[[Rabbit-Proof Fence (film)|Rabbit-Proof Fence]]'' (2002).{{sfn|ASO – Rabbit-Proof Fence}}

The [[soundtrack]] of the 2006 film ''[[Ten Canoes]]'' directed by [[Rolf de Heer]] was filmed entirely in dialects of the [[Yolŋu Matha]] language group, with the main version featuring subtitles and English narration by David Gulpilil. 

48. 
Attainment of Year 12 or equivalent qualification for ages 20–24 has increased from 47.4% in 2006 to 65.3% in 2016, thus narrowing the gap by 12.6 percentage points.{{sfn|OPMC Closing the Gap}} Furthermore, this completion of Year 12 qualifications has resulted in a greater number of Aboriginal persons undertaking higher education or vocational education courses. 

49. 

The [[National Gallery of Australia]] exhibits a great many Indigenous art works, including those of the [[Torres Strait Islands]] who are known for their traditional sculpture and headgear.{{sfn|NGA – ATSI}}

Aboriginal art has influenced many non-Indigenous artists, such as [[Margaret Preston]] (1875–1963) and [[Elizabeth Durack]] (1915 – 2000). 

50. 
{{harv|Thomson|2001|p=153}}}}
More recent work suggests that Aboriginal populations exceeded 1.2&nbsp;million 500 years ago, but may have fallen somewhat with the introduction of disease pathogens from Eurasia in the last 500 years.{{sfn|William|2013}} The population was split into 250 individual nations,{{sfn|Horton|1996}} many of which were in alliance with one another, and within each nation there existed separate, often related [[clan]]s, from as few as 5 or 6 to as many as 30 or 40. 

51. 
Samuel Macfarlane arrived on [[Darnley Island, Torres Strait|Erub (Darnley Island)]] on 1 July 1871, establishing its first base in the region there. 

52. 
The Islanders refer to this as "The Coming of the Light", or "Coming of Light"{{sfn|Korff|2019}} and all Island communities celebrate the occasion annually on 1 July.{{sfn|TSRA - history}} However the coming of Christianity did not spell the end of the people's traditional beliefs; their culture informed their understanding of the new religion, as the [[Christian God]] was welcomed and the new religion was integrated into every aspect of their everyday lives.{{sfn|Korff|2019}}

===Recent census figures===
In the 2016 Census, Australia's Indigenous and non-Indigenous population were broadly similar with 54% (vs 55%) reporting a [[Christianity in Australia|Christian]] affiliation, while less than 2% reported traditional beliefs as their religion, and 36% reported no religion. 

53. 
[[Albert Namatjira]] became a painter, and actors such as [[David Gulpilil]], [[Ernie Dingo]], and [[Deborah Mailman]] became well known.

The populations in Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales are more likely to be urbanised.{{sfn|ABoS – population|2006}}

The proportion of Aboriginal adults married (''de facto'' or ''[[de jure]]'') to non-Aboriginal spouses increased to 78.2% in the 2016 census,{{sfn|ABoS 2077.0|2018}} up from 74% in 2011,{{sfn|ABoS 2077.0}} 64% in 1996, 51% in 1991 and 46% in 1986.

Dixon]], suggest that the Pama–Nyungan group – and indeed the entire Australian linguistic area – is rather a ''[[sprachbund]]'', or group of languages having very long and intimate contact, rather than a [[genetic (linguistics)|genetic]] language family.{{sfn|Dixon|1997}}

It has been suggested that, given their long presence in Australia, Aboriginal languages form one specific sub-grouping. 

59. 
There is also evidence of the construction of large, complex [[Stilt house|buildings on stilts]] and [[dome]]d structures using [[bamboo]], with [[thatched roofs]], which catered for extended family members living together.{{sfn|Pascoe|2018}}

=== British colonisation ===
====Dates by area====
[[File:Batman signs treaty artist impression.jpg|thumb|[[Wurundjeri]] people at the signing of [[Batman's Treaty]], 1835]]
[[British colonisation of Australia]] began with the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] in [[Botany Bay]], New South Wales, in 1788. 

60. 
The other indigenous language spoken mainly in the eastern islands is [[Meriam language|Meriam Mir]]: a member of the [[Trans-Fly languages]] spoken on the nearby south coast of New Guinea and the only [[Papuan languages|Papuan language]] spoken on Australian territory. 

61. 
[[List of massacres of Indigenous Australians|Massacres]] and [[Australian frontier wars|war]] by British settlers also contributed to depopulation.{{sfn|Evans|Ørsted-Jensen|2014|p=28}}{{sfn|ABC News|2017}} The characterisation of this violence as [[genocide]] is controversial and disputed.{{sfn|Levene|2005|p=344 n.105}}

Although there are a number of commonalities among the various Aboriginal peoples, there is also a great diversity among different communities and societies in Australia, each with its own mixture of cultures, customs and languages. 

62. 
In the 19th century, smallpox was the principal cause of Aboriginal deaths, and vaccinations of the "native inhabitants" had begun in earnest by the 1840s.{{sfn|Glynn|Jenifer|2004|pp=145–146}} This smallpox epidemic in 1789 is estimated to have killed up to 90% of the [[Darug people]].

To this day, this forced removal has had a huge impact on the psyche of Aboriginal Australians; it has seriously impacted not only the children removed and their parents, but their descendants as well.

=== Crime ===
{{Main|Indigenous Australians and crime}}

Aboriginal Australians are overrepresented in Australia's criminal justice system. 

65. 

Australia was the exception to British imperial colonisation practices, in that no treaty was drawn up setting out terms of agreement between the settlers and native proprietors, as was the case in North America, and [[Treaty of Waitangi|New Zealand]].{{sfn|Broome|2010|p=18}} Many of the men on the First Fleet had had military experience among Native American tribes in North America, and tended to attribute to the Aboriginal people alien and misleading systems or concepts like [[Tribal chief|chieftainship]] and [[tribe]] with which they had become acquainted in the northern hemisphere.{{sfn|Foley|2007|pp=177–179}}

British administrative control began in the Torres Strait Islands in 1862, with the appointment of John Jardine, police magistrate at [[Rockhampton]], as Government Resident in the Torres Straits. 

66. 

From 1996 to 2001, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) used indirect methods for its calculations, because census results were deemed to be unreliable,{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} and figures published in 2005 (59.4 years for males and 64.8 years for females) indicated a widely quoted gap of 17 years between indigenous and non-indigenous life expectancy, though the ABS does not now consider the 2005 figures to be reliable. 

67. 
However, although there is still no move toward a treaty at federal level, it is contended that the Noongar Settlement (South West Native Title Settlement) in Western Australia in 2016 constitutes a treaty, and at the state and territory levels there are currently (early 2018) other negotiations and preparatory legislation.{{sfn|Hobbs|Williams|2018}} In [[South Australia]], however, following the [[2018 South Australian state election|2018 state election]] negotiations have been "paused".{{sfn|Wahlquist|2018}} In June 2018, the [[Parliament of Victoria]] passed a bill to advance the process of establishing a treaty with Aboriginal Victorians.{{sfn|Offer|2018}}

=== Cross-cultural miscommunication ===

Indigenous languages are divided into language groups with from ten to twenty-four language families identified.{{sfn|ABoS|2012}} It is currently estimated that up to 145 Indigenous languages remain in use, of which fewer than 20 are considered to be strong in the sense that they are still spoken by all age groups.{{sfn|ABoS|2012}}{{sfn|Zuckermann|2009}} All but 13 Indigenous languages are considered to be endangered.{{sfn|AIATSIS|2014}} Several extinct Indigenous languages are being reconstructed.

In 2004, the [[Howard government]] disbanded ATSIC and replaced it with an appointed network of thirty Indigenous Coordination Centres that administer Shared Responsibility Agreements and Regional Partnership Agreements with Aboriginal communities at a local level.{{sfn|OIPC|2006}}

In October 2007, just before the calling of a [[2007 Australian general election|federal election]], the then Prime Minister, John Howard, revisited the idea of bringing a referendum to seek recognition of Indigenous Australians in the Constitution (his government first sought to include recognition of Aboriginal peoples in the Preamble to the Constitution in a 1999 referendum). 

155. 
By 1995, population numbers had reached pre-colonisation levels, and in 2010 there were around 563,000 Indigenous Australians.{{sfn|Hugo|2012}}

Although, as [[British subject]]s, all Indigenous Australians were nominally entitled to vote, generally only those who merged into mainstream society did so. 

156. 

During the twentieth century, as social attitudes shifted and interest in Indigenous culture increased, there were more opportunities for Indigenous Australians to gain recognition. 

157. 
590,056 respondents declared they were Aboriginal, 32,345 declared they were [[Torres Strait Islander]], and a further 26,767 declared they were both Aboriginal and [[Torres Strait Islanders]].{{sfn|ABoS Census|2017}} Growth has been mainly in major cities and along the eastern coast of Australia. 

158. 
In 1976, Sir [[Douglas Nicholls]] was appointed as the 28th Governor of South Australia, the first Aboriginal person appointed to vice-regal office.{{sfn|Civics and Citizenship Education|2005}} In the [[2010 Australian federal election|general election of 2010]], [[Ken Wyatt]] of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] became the first Indigenous Australian elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives]].

Campaigns continue to have Aboriginal body parts returned to Australia for burial; Truganini's body was returned in 1976 and cremated, and her ashes were scattered according to her wishes.{{cn|date=January 2020}}<!--in her article linked above--><!---yes, but still needs citations in this article--->

Place names sometimes reveal discrimination, such as Mount Jim Crow in [[Rockhampton, Queensland]] (now [[Mount Baga]]), as well as racist policies, like Brisbane's Boundary Streets which used to indicate boundaries where Aboriginal people were not allowed to cross during certain times of the day.{{sfn|Condon|2011}} There is ongoing discussion about changing many of these names.{{sfn|McMah|2016}}{{sfn|Terzon|Robinson|2018}}

[[File:Indigenous-wages-graph.jpg|thumb|Graph showing the destination of Indigenous wages in Queensland in the 19th and 20th centuries]]
Throughout most of the 19th and 20th centuries, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had their lives under the jurisdiction of various state-based protection laws.

[[Oodgeroo Noonuccal]] (1920–1995) was a famous Aboriginal poet, writer and rights activist, credited with publishing the first book of verse by an Aboriginal author, ''We Are Going'' (1964).{{sfn|Modern Australian poetry}} [[Sally Morgan (artist)|Sally Morgan]]'s novel ''[[My Place (book)|My Place]]'' (1987) was considered a breakthrough memoir in terms of bringing Indigenous stories to a wider audience. 

162. 
Employed Aboriginal Australians are more likely to experience discrimination than those who are unemployed, and it has been found that the second most common source of unfair treatment after members of the public is while Aboriginal persons are at work or applying for work. 

163. 
Aboriginal women are again highly overrepresented in this figure, accounting for a higher proportion of assault victims than the non-Aboriginal category.{{sfn|ABoS Victims of Crime|2017}}

In 2007, the Northern Territory Government commissioned a study into sexual abuse crimes being committed on children in Aboriginal communities.

== Population ==
===Pre-colonisation===
It has been variously estimated that before the arrival of British settlers, the population of Indigenous (probably Aboriginal only) Australians was approximately 318,000–1,000,000{{sfn|Gough|2011}} with the distribution being similar to that of the current Australian population, the majority living in the south-east, centred along the [[Murray River]].{{sfn|Pardoe|2006|pp=1–21}}

=== Definition ===
Over time Australia has used various means to determine membership of ethnic groups such as [[Lineage (genetic)|lineage]], [[Blood quantum laws|blood quantum]], birth and [[self-determination]].

However, traditional Aboriginal conversational interaction is "communal", broadcast to many people, eye contact is not important, the listener controls the interaction; and "continuous", spread over a longer, indefinite time frame.{{sfn|Zuckermann|2015|p=12}}{{sfn|Zuckermann|2015|p=12}}{{sfn|Walsh|1997|pp=7–9}}

After the arrival of European settlers in New South Wales, some Indigenous Australians became translators and go-betweens; the best-known was [[Bennelong]], who eventually adopted European dress and customs and travelled to England where he was presented to [[King George III]]. 

168. 
[[Carol Martin (politician)|Carol Martin]] was the first Aboriginal woman elected to an Australian parliament (the [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly]]) in 2001, and the first woman minister was [[Marion Scrymgour]], who was appointed to the Northern Territory ministry in 2002 (she became Deputy Chief Minister in 2008).{{sfn|AEC|2007}} Representation in the Northern Territory has been relatively high, reflecting the high proportion of Aboriginal voters. 

169. 
A further 4% of Indigenous Australians identify themselves as having both Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal heritage.{{sfn|ABoS|2004a}}

The [[Torres Strait Islands]] comprise over 100 islands{{sfn|Places – Torres Strait Islands|2005}} which were annexed by Queensland in 1879.{{sfn|Places – Torres Strait Islands|2005}} Many Indigenous organisations incorporate the phrase "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander" to highlight the distinctiveness and importance of Torres Strait Islanders in Australia's Indigenous population. 

170. 
(See also below under [[Indigenous Australians#Regional groups|Regional groups]] section.) The abbreviation "ATSI" (for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people) is considered disrespectful.{{sfn|Appropriate words & terminology}}

==== Terms "black" and "blackfella" ====
The term "black" has been used to refer to Indigenous Australians since European settlement.{{sfn|''Hobart Town Courier''|1828|p=1}} While originally related to [[skin colour]] and often used pejoratively,{{sfn|Common Ground}} the term is used today to indicate Aboriginal heritage or culture in general and refers to any people of such heritage regardless of their level of skin pigmentation.{{sfn|Bird|2011}} In the 1970s, many Aboriginal activists, such as [[Gary Foley]], proudly embraced the term "black", and writer [[Kevin Gilbert (author)|Kevin Gilbert]]'s book from the time was entitled ''Living Black''.
