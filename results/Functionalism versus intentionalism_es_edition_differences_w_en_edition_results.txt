"sfn" Kershaw-2008-p-259-It is unclear whether it was a decision taken on Hitler's own initiative motivated solely by his own anti-Semitic prejudices, or ordered the other three Einsatzgruppen to emulate the bloody example of Einsatzgruppe A (impressed with the Einsatzgruppe A's will and ability to murder Jewish women and children)

For Hitler, Bolshevism meant the consummate government of the ''Jewish''', while democracy - as had developed in [[Western Europe]] and [[Weimar Republic] Weimar]- represented a preliminary stage of Bolshevism, as Jews there gained a main, more not yet dominant, influence

"sfn" Broszat-1985-pp-408–413-In this way, Broszat argued that the Shoah did not start in response to an order, written or unwritten, from Hitler, but was rather "a way out of the impasse in which the Nazis had maneuvered"

Criticism has focused on the fact that none of these claims relate sits to killing all the Jewish people; in fact, very few refer to killing Jews at all

In 1981, the British historian [Timothy Mason] published an essay entitled "Intention and Explanation", which was a partial attack on the positions of [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]] and [Klaus Hildebrand], whom Mason accused of focusing too much on the figure of [Adolf Hitler] rather than making a concrete explanation of the Holocaust

"sfn" Rees-1997-p-195-[Ian Kershaw' Sir Ian Kershaw]] contends thatthe dramatic expansion in both the rank of casualties and the intensity of the killings after mid-August 1941 indicates that Hitler issued an order to that effect, most likely a verbal order transmitted to the commanders of Einsatzgruppen to through Himmler or Heydrich

By contrast, the Swiss historian Philippe Burrin argues that such a decision was not taken before August 1941, pointing out the orders given by the top leader of the [Schutzstaffel], [SS], [[Heinrich Himmler]], on July 30, 1941 to the 2nd Cavalry Regiment of the SS and SS Cavalry Brigade operating in the [Pinsk Marshes] in Operation Pripyat, which called for the murder of male Jews only while Jewish women and children were to be taken to them (marshes)

This school clings a great deal to Hitler's "speech of Prophecy" on January 30, 1939 to the [Reichstag (German Parliament) Reichstag] where Reichstag stated that "Jewish financiers began another world war, (...) and that then the result would be the annihilation of the entire Jewish race in Europe." The main problem with this thesis, as [[Yehuda Bauer]] points out, is that although this statement clearly compromises Hitler to genocide, he made no effort after delivering this speech to be carried out

"Interpretations"
"Extreme Intentionalism"
Extreme intentionists believe that Hitler definitely had as a plan the Holocaust for 1924, if not before
0.0802936

0.0802936
The phrase "cumulative radicalization" is used in this context to summarize how extreme rhetoric and competition between the various Nazi agencies produced increasingly extreme policies, while bureaucratic deputy zeacons put into practice what they believed Hitler would have approved based on his widely disseminated and propaganda discourses

"sfn" Rees-1997-p-195-Browning argues that sometime in mid-July 1941 Hitler made the decision to begin a general genocide because of his enthusiasm for his victories over the Red Army, while Burrin argues that the decision was made at the end of August 1941 due to Hitler's frustration at the slowdown of the [Wehrmacht]

"sfn" Haberer-2001-p-65-The Baltic area witnessed both the most extensive and intense killings of all Einsatzgruppen with a number of 90,000 to 100,000 Jews killed between July and October 1941, which led to the near-total destruction of communities Jews in that area

Only once in [[Mein Kampf]Hitler refers to killing Jews when he claims that if only 12,000 to 15,000 Jews had been gassed instead of German soldiers during [World War I]], then the "sacrifice of millions on the front would not have been in vain." Since Mein Kampf is 694 pages long, Dawidowicz's critics make too much of a phrase

The criticism focuses on the idea that this explanation does not really show why the Nazis would deport the Jews of [[France]] and the [[Netherlands] to death camps in Poland if Poland cared for the Nazis, and why the Jews of Poland were targeted to a random samples of 25% of the Polish population

Given the fact that scholars have written so much about Nazi Germany, Richard Bessel states that "the result is a much more informed, much more detailed and more nuanced image of the Nazi regime, and most serious historians of the Nazi regime are now, to some extent, "intentionalist" and "functionalist," to the extent that those terms can still be used at all." <ref>Richard Bessel, "Functionalists vs

Although neither side disputes the reality of the Holocaust, nor is there a dispute over the premise that Hitler (such as [fuhrer]] was personally responsible for encouraging the anti-Semitism that allowed the Holocaust to occur, the hanomists argue that the initiative came from above, while the functionalists argue that it came from the lower ranks within the Nazi bureaucracy

"sfn" Haberer-2001-p-70-Haberer argues that the "high point of the Baltic genocide" occurred at the time when the other Nazi plans for a territorial final solution such as the [Madagascar Plan] were unlikely, suggesting that for Nazi leaders the genocide the genocide was in fact "feasible" to a "final solution to the Jewish question"
