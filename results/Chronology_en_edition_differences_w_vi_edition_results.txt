The study of the means of placing pottery and other cultural artifacts into some kind of order proceeds in two phases, classification and typology: Classification creates categories for the purposes of description, and typology seeks to identify and analyse changes that allow artifacts to be placed into sequences.<ref>{{cite book | last =Greene | first =Kevin | authorlink = | title =Archaeology : An Introduction | publisher =University of Newcastle Upon Tyne | date =November 2007 | location = | pages =Chapter 4 | url =http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/kevin.greene/wintro/chap4.htm | isbn = | accessdate =2008-01-04 | nopp =true | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20050329085720/http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/kevin.greene/wintro/chap4.htm | archive-date =2005-03-29 | url-status =dead }}</ref>

Much of modern historical datings and chronology of the ancient world ultimately derives from these two works.<ref name=Grafton>{{cite book|last1=Grafton|first1=Anthony|title=Joseph Scaliger: A Study in the History of Classical Scholarship|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}</ref> Scaliger invented the concept of the [[Julian day|Julian Day]] which is still used as the standard unified scale of time for both historians and astronomers.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In addition to the literary methods of synchronism used by traditional chronographers such as Eusebius, Syncellus and Scaliger, it is possible to synchronize events by archaeological or astronomical means
