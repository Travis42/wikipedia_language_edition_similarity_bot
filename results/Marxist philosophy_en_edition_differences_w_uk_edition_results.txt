On the other hand, [[Costanzo Preve]] (1990) has assigned four "masters" to Marx: [[Epicurus]] (to whom he dedicated his thesis, ''Difference of natural philosophy between [[Democritus]] and Epicurus'', 1841) for his materialism and theory of [[clinamen]] which opened up a realm of [[liberty]]; [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], from which come his idea of [[egalitarian]] [[democracy]]; [[Adam Smith]], from whom came the idea that the grounds of [[property]] is [[Manual labour|labour]]; and finally [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]

Instead, Marx aspired to give [[ontological]] priority to what he called the "real life process" of real human beings, as he and Engels said in ''The German Ideology'' (1846):

(c) The phenomena of history arise from a whole with an essence which undergoes transformation of form and which has an end or telos.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|32}} For Hegel, the essence of humanity is freedom, and the telos of that essence is the actualization of that freedom.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|32}} Like Aristotle, Hegel believes the essence of a thing is revealed in the entire, typical process of development of that thing
5.42855e-12
Indeed, in 1844, by the look of Marx's writings in that period (most famous of which is the "[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]", a text that most explicitly elaborated his [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]]), Marx's thinking could have taken at least three possible courses: the study of law, religion, and the state; the study of natural philosophy; and the study of [[political economy]]
2.87059e-11
Furthermore, he [[Marx's theory of human nature|criticized Feuerbach's conception of human nature]] in his sixth thesis on Feuerbach as an abstract "kind" which incarnated itself in each singular individual: "Feuerbach resolves the essence of [[religion]] into the essence of man (''menschliche Wesen'', human nature)

It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness.</blockquote>

In this brief popularization of his ideas, Marx emphasized that social development sprang from the inherent contradictions within material life and the social [[base and superstructure|superstructure]]

Balibar observes that, in the end, Althusser enjoined the most sober definition of communism, exposed by Marx in ''[[The German Ideology]]'': ''Communism is "not a state of the future, but the real movement which destroys the existing state of being.".''

In reality, it is the ensemble of the social relations."

Thereupon, instead of founding itself on the singular, concrete individual [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], as did classic philosophy, including [[contractualism]] ([[Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Rousseau]]) but also [[political economy]], Marx began with the totality of social relations: labour, language and all which constitute our human existence

In 1844-5, when Marx was starting to settle his account with Hegel and the Young Hegelians in his writings, he critiqued the Young Hegelians for limiting the horizon of their critique to religion and not taking up the critique of the state and civil society as paramount
9.6378e-11

==== Criticisms of human rights ====
In the same way, following [[Gracchus Babeuf|Babeuf]], considered as one of the founder of communism during the [[French Revolution]], he criticized the 1789 ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' as a "bourgeois declaration" of the rights of the "egoistic individual", ultimately based on the "right to private property", which [[economism]] deduced from its own implicit "philosophy of the subject", which asserts the preeminence of an individual and [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] subject over social relations
1.34946e-10
Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life.</blockquote>

Also, in his ''[[Theses on Feuerbach]]'' (1845), in which the young Marx broke with Feuerbach's idealism, he writes that "the philosophers have only described the world, in various ways, the point is to change it," and his materialist approach allows for and empowers such change

However, as Étienne Balibar  puts it, "the accent put on those contradictions can not not ring out on the signification of 'human rights', since these therefore appears ''both'' as the language in which [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] masks itself and as the one in which the exploited class struggle express itself: more than a truth or an illusion, it is therefore a ''stake''".<ref>[[Étienne Balibar]], ''The Philosophy of Marx'', 1993, p.74 original edition</ref> ''Das Kapital'' ironizes on the "pompous catalogue of the human rights" in comparison to the "modest ''Magna Charta'' of a day work limited by law":

In lieu of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] belief in historical progress and stages espoused by [[Hegel]] (often in a [[racism|racist]], [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] manner, as in his ''Lectures on the Philosophy of History''), Marx pursues in these research notes a decidedly empirical approach to analyzing historical changes and different modes of production, emphasizing without forcing them into a [[teleology|teleological]] paradigm the rich varieties of communal productions throughout the world and the critical importance of collective working-class antagonism in the development of capitalism

The historical process, however, never attempts to preserve an essence in the first place.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|36}} Rather, it develops an essence through successive forms.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|36}} This means that at any moment on the path of historical change, there is a contradiction between what exists and what is in the process of coming-to-be.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|36}} The realization of a natural thing like a tree is a process that by and large points back toward itself: every step of the process takes place in order to reproduce the genus

In place of the pompous catalogue of the "inalienable rights of man" comes the modest Magna Charta of a legally limited working-day, which shall make clear "when the time which the worker sells is ended, and when his own begins.'' Quantum mutatus ab illo!''[How changed from what he/it was!]"<ref>Karl Marx, ''Das Kapital, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm#S7 chapter X, section 7]</ref>}}
But the communist revolution does not end with the negation of individual liberty and equality ("[[collectivism]]"<ref>[[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]] argued that Marx represented exacerbated [[individualism]] instead of [[holism]] as the popular interpretation of Marxism as "collectivism" would have it</ref>), but with the "negation of the negation": "individual property" in the capitalist regime is in fact the "expropriation of the immediate producers." "Self-earned private property, that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated, independent laboring-individual with the conditions of his labor, is supplanted by capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labor of others, i.e., on wage-labor..

Although some have separated Marx's works between a "[[young Marx]]" (in particular the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]'') and a "mature Marx" or also by separating it into purely philosophical works, economics works and political and historical interventions, Étienne Balibar (1993) has pointed out that Marx's works can be divided into "economic works" (''[[Das Kapital]]'', 1867), "philosophical works" and "historical works" (''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte]]'', the 1871 ''[[The Civil War in France|Civil War in France]]'' which concerned the [[Paris Commune]] and acclaimed it as the first "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]", etc.)

Marx's philosophy is thus inextricably linked to his [[critique of political economy]] and to his historical interventions in the [[workers' movement]], such as the 1875 ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]'' or ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', written with Engels (who was observing the [[Chartist movement]]) a year before the [[Revolutions of 1848]]

This [[positivism|positivist]] reading, which mostly based itself on Engels' latter writings in an attempt to theorize "[[scientific socialism]]" (an expression coined by Engels) has been challenged by Marxist theorists, such as Lukacs, Gramsci, Althusser or, more recently, Étienne Balibar.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

=== Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel ===
{{See also|Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel}}
Marx developed a comprehensive, theoretical understanding of political reality early in his intellectual and activist career by means of a critical adoption and radicalization of the categories of 18th and 19th century German Idealist thought

=== Rupture with German idealism and the Young Hegelians ===

Marx did not study directly with Hegel, but after Hegel died Marx studied under one of Hegel's pupils, [[Bruno Bauer]], a leader of the circle of Young Hegelians to whom Marx attached himself

This does not re-establish private property for the producer, but gives him individual property based on the acquisition of the capitalist era: i.e., on co-operation and the possession in common of the land and of the means of production.<ref>Karl Marx, ''Das Kapital'', [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch32.htm chapter XXXII, section 1]</ref>

==== Criticisms of Ludwig Feuerbach ====
{{Main|Ludwig Feuerbach|Marx's theory of alienation}}
What distinguished Marx from Feuerbach was his view of Feuerbach's [[humanism]] as excessively abstract, and so no less ahistorical and idealist than what it purported to replace, namely the reified notion of God found in institutional Christianity that legitimized the repressive power of the Prussian state
0.037783

Marx thereby modified his theory of alienation exposed in the ''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844'' and would later arrive to his theory of [[commodity fetishism]], exposed in the first chapter of the first book of ''Das Kapital'' (1867)

 They are: (1) the replacement of mechanism and atomism with Aristotelean categories of organicism and essentialism, (2) the idea that world history progresses through stages, (3) the difference between natural and historical (dialectical) change, and (4) the idea that dialectical change proceeds through contradictions in the thing itself

They have no history, no development; but men, developing their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with this, their real existence, their thinking, and the products of their thinking

Marx's movement away from university philosophy and towards the [[workers' movement]] is thus inextricably linked to his rupture with his earlier writings, which pushed Marxist commentators to speak of a "young Marx" and a "mature Marx", although the nature of this cut poses problems

This abandonment of the early theory of alienation would be amply discussed, and several Marxist theorists, including [[Marxist humanist]]s such as the [[Praxis School]], would return to it

However, "Althusser never ceased to put in question the ''images of communism'' that Marxist theory and ideology carried on: but he did it in the name of communism itself." Althusser thus criticized the [[Sociocultural evolution|evolutionist]] image which made of communism an ultimate stage of history, as well as the apocalyptic images which made it a "society of transparence", "without contradiction" nor ideology

 It is delivered by means of the actions of men which spring from their needs, passions, and interests.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|32}} Teleology, according to Hegel, is not opposed to the efficient causation provided by passion; on the contrary, the latter is the vehicle realizing the former.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|32}} Hegel consistently lays more stress on passion than on the more historically specifiable interests of men.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|32}} Marx will reverse this priority.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|32}}

'''(3) Difference between natural and historical change'''

Hegel distinguishes as Aristotle did not between the application of organic, essentialist categories to the realm of human history and the realm of organic nature.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|33}} According to Hegel, human history strives toward perfectibility, but nature does not.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|34}} Marx deepens and expands this idea into the claim that humankind itself can adapt society to its own purposes rather than adapting themselves to it.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|34}}

Natural and historical change, according to Hegel, have two different kinds of essences.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|34}} Organic natural entities develop through a straightforward process, relatively simple to comprehend at least in outline.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|34}} Historical development, however, is a more complex process.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|35}} Its specific difference is its "dialectical" character.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|35}} The process of natural development occurs in a relatively straight line from the germ to the fully realized being and back to the germ again

Marxist and Marx-influenced 20th century theory, such as (to name a few random examples) the [[Critical theory (Frankfurt School)|critical theory of the Frankfurt School]], the political writing of [[Antonio Gramsci]], and the [[neo-Marxism]] of [[Fredric Jameson]], must take Marx's condemnation of philosophy into account, but many such thinkers also feel a strong need to remedy the perceived theoretical problems with [[orthodox Marxism]]

In the development of a natural thing, there is by and large no contradiction between the process of development and the way that development must appear.<ref name="Meikle"/>{{rp|36}} So the transition from an acorn, to an oak, to an acorn again occurs in a relatively uninterrupted flow of the acorn back to itself again

Marx's critique of the ideology of the human rights thus departs from the [[counterrevolutionary]] critique by [[Edmund Burke]], who dismissed the "rights of Man" in favour of the "rights of the individual": it is not grounded on an opposition to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s [[Universality (philosophy)|universalism]] and [[humanism|humanist]] project on behalf of the right of [[tradition]], as in Burke's case, but rather on the claim that the ideology of economism and the ideology of the human rights are the reverse sides of the same coin

==== Historical materialism ====
{{Main|Historical materialism|Dialectical materialism}}
Marx summarized the materialistic aspect of his theory of history, otherwise known as [[historical materialism]] (this term was coined by Engels and popularised by [[Karl Kautsky]] and [[Georgi Plekhanov]]), in the 1859 preface to ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'':

<blockquote>In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely [[relations of production]] appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material [[forces of production]]
0.163605

The base-superstructure and [[stadial history|stadialist]] formulations in the 1859 preface took on canonical status in the subsequent development of orthodox Marxism, in particular in [[dialectical materialism]] (''diamat'', as it was [[philosophy in the Soviet Union|known in the Soviet Union]])
