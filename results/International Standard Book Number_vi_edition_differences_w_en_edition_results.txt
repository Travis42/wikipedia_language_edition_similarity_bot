For example, calculating the test number for the number sequence ISBN 10 number that the first 9 digits is 0-306-40615 is executed as follows:

10 × 0 + 9 × 3 + 8 × 0 + 7 × 6 + 6 × 4 + 5 × 0 + 4 × 6 + 3 × 1 + 2 × 5
 = 0 + 27 + 0 + 42 + 24 + 0 + 24 + 3 + 10
 = 130

The smallest number to add to can be split by 11 is 2, due to 132/11 = 12 and no residual
0.236477
A similar format, ' ' International Standard Serial Number ' ' (International Standard Code for magazines) or ISSN, is used for periodic publications such as [[Magazine]]
0.282933
For example, to find the test number for the 10 ISBN number the first 9 digits are 0-306-40615:

1 × 0 + 2 × 3 + 3 × 0 + 4 × 6 + 5 × 4 + 6 × 0 + 7 × 6 + 8 × 1 + 9 × 5
 = 0 + 6 + 0 + 24 + 20 + 0 + 42 + 8 + 45
 = 145
 = 13 × 11 + 2

Thus the number of checks equals 2, and the complete number sequence is <nowiki> ISBN 0-306-40615-2 </nowiki>
