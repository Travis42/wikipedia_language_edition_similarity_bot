Set in present-day New York and Jerusalem, the play follows a German/Israeli family  riven by conflict when the geneticist son wants to marry an Arab-American woman who is doing her doctoral dissertation on Hassan al-Wazzan/[[Leo Africanus]], the subject of Davis' ''Trickster Travels''<ref>Christian Rioux, "Wajid Mouawad triomphe a Paris,"''Le Devoir'', December 5, 2017.</ref> Her book (in-process), ''Braided Histories'' on 18th-century [[Suriname]] studies [[social network|networks]] of communication and association among families, both [[slave]] and free, on the [[plantations]] of Christian and Jewish settlers.<ref>http://www.forward.com/articles/a-star-historian-opens-a-new-chapter-jewish-slave</ref>

Though Davis's historical writings are extensively researched, she sometimes resorts to speculation, using analogous evidence and inserting words like "perhaps" and phrases like "she may have thought." Some critics of her work find this troubling and think that this practice threatens the empirical base of the historian's profession.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed to demonstrate this fact|date=October 2013}}  Davis's answer to this is suggested in her 1992 essay "Stories and the Hunger to Know," where she argues both for the role of interpretation by historians and their essential quest for evidence about the past: both must be present and acknowledged to keep people from claiming that they have an absolute handle on "truth." She opened her ''Women on the Margins'' with an imaginary dialogue, in which her three subjects upbraid her for her approach and for putting them in the same book.
