Leap year

en edition's differences with the vi version: 


1. 
In the [[Bahá'í Calendar]], a leap day is added when needed to ensure that the following year begins on the [[vernal equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|vernal equinox]]. 

2. 
Years begin at Naw-Rúz, on the [[vernal equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|vernal equinox]], on or about March 21. 

3. 
This period normally has 4 days, but an extra day is added when needed to ensure that the following year starts on the [[vernal equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|vernal equinox]]. 

4. 
This is to ensure that [[Passover]] ({{transl|he|''Pesah''}}) is always in the spring as required by the [[Torah]] (Pentateuch) in many verses<ref>Exodus 23,15 ; Exodus 34,18 ; Deuteronomy 15,1 ; Deuteronomy 15, 13</ref> relating to Passover.

Over a period of four centuries, the accumulated error of adding a leap day ''every'' four years amounts to about three extra days. 

8. 
Because only 22 or 23 days were effectively added, not a full lunation, the calends and ides of the Roman Republican calendar were no longer associated with the new moon and full moon. 

9. 
This rule is known in Hebrew as "{{transl|he|''lo adu rosh''}}" ({{lang|he|לא אד"ו ראש}}), i.e., "Rosh [ha-Shanah, first day of the year] is not Sunday, Wednesday or Friday" (as the Hebrew word {{transl|he|''adu''}} is written by three [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] signifying Sunday, Wednesday and Friday). 

10. 
This rule is known in Hebrew as "{{transl|he|''lo badu Pesah''}}" ({{lang|he|לא בד"ו פסח}}), which has a double meaning — "Passover is not a legend", but also "Passover is not Monday, Wednesday or Friday" (as the Hebrew word {{transl|he|''badu''}} is written by three Hebrew letters signifying Monday, Wednesday and Friday). 

11. 
Caesar also replaced the intercalary month by a single intercalary day, located where the intercalary month used to be. 

12. 

==Julian, Coptic and Ethiopian calendars==
From AD 8 the Julian calendar received an extra day added to February in years that are multiples of 4. 

13. 
This extra month is called ''Adar Alef'' ([[Adar 1|first Adar]]) and is added before ''[[Adar]]'', which then becomes ''Adar Bet'' ([[Adar 2|second Adar]]). 

14. 
But if there is no corresponding day in the last month, the period ends with the ending of the last day of the last month.<ref>{{citation | article = Article 121 Civil Code | url = http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=B0000001 | title = Part I General Principles of the Republic of China}}</ref>}}

20. 
This rule agrees with the rule for the Gregorian calendar until 2799. 

21. 

One reason for this rule is that [[Yom Kippur]], the holiest day in the Hebrew calendar and the tenth day of the Hebrew year, now must never be adjacent to the weekly Sabbath (which is Saturday), i.e., it must never fall on Friday or Sunday, in order not to have two adjacent Sabbath days. 

22. 
[[Ancient Rome|The Romans]] counted days inclusively in their calendars, so this was actually the fifth day before March 1 when counted in the modern exclusive manner (not including the starting day).<ref>{{citation | first = Thomas Hewitt | last = Key | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Calendarium.html | title = Calendarium | publisher = University of Chicago | orig-year = 1875 | date = 2013}}</ref>

The religious festivals that were normally celebrated in the last five days of February were moved to the last five days of Intercalaris. 

27. 

For example, in the [[Gregorian calendar]], each leap year has 366 days instead of 365, by [[February 29|extending February to 29 days]] rather than the common 28. 

28. 
The days of these calendars were counted down (inclusively) to the next named day, so February 24 was ''ante diem sextum Kalendas Martias'' ("the sixth day before the calends of March") often abbreviated a.

(the days numbered 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28 from the beginning of February in a common year), so that the intercalated day was the ''first'' half of the doubled day. 

30. 
Other feasts normally falling on February 25–28 in common years are also shifted to the following day in a leap year (although they would be on the same day according to the Roman notation).

The Gregorian calendar was designed to keep the [[vernal equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|vernal equinox]] on or close to March 21, so that the date of [[Easter]] (celebrated on the Sunday after the ecclesiastical [[full moon]] that falls on or after March 21) remains close to the vernal equinox.<ref>{{citation | first = E.

These extra days occur in years which are multiples of four (with the exception of centennial years not divisible by 400).

According to the [[Metonic cycle]], this is done seven times every nineteen years (specifically, in years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19). 

38. 
This phenomenon is exploited when a person claims to be only a quarter of their actual age, by counting their leap-year birthday anniversaries only: for example, in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s 1879 [[comic opera]] ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', Frederic the pirate apprentice discovers that he is bound to serve the pirates until his 21st ''birthday'' (that is, when he turns 88 years old, since 1900 was not a leap year) rather than until his 21st ''year''.

This system has less periodic deviation or jitter from its mean year than the Gregorian calendar, and operates on the simple rule that the vernal equinox always falls in the 24-hour period ending at noon on New Year's Day.<ref name=jitter>{{citation |last=Bromberg |first=Irv |title=Fixed Arithmetic Calendar Cycle Jitter |publisher=University of Toronto |url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/intervalmath/}}</ref> The 33-year period is not completely regular; every so often the 33-year cycle will be broken by a cycle of 29 years.<ref>{{citation | first = M.
