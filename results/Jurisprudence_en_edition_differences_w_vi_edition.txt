6</ref> In his book ''[[Law's Empire]]'',<ref>Ronald Dworkin, ''Law's Empire'' (1986) [[Harvard University Press]]</ref> Dworkin argued that law is an "interpretive" concept that requires barristers to find the best-fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions.

Kelsen contends that the extent to which legal norms are binding, their specifically "legal" character, can be understood without tracing it ultimately to some suprahuman source such as God, personified Nature or—of great importance in his time—a personified State or Nation.

There are two separate schools of legal realism: American legal realism and Scandinavian legal realism. 

32. 
</ref>

The Scandinavian school of legal realism argued that law can be explained through the empirical methods used by social scientists.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xZVw0EcmYh8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=thinking+like+a+lawyer#v=onepage&q=thinking%20like%20a%20lawyer&f=false|title=Thinking Like a Lawyer|last=Schauer|first=Frederick|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780674032705|location=Cambridge|pages=124 n.1|language=en}}</ref> Prominent Scandinavian legal realists are [[Alf Ross]], [[Axel Hägerström]], and [[Karl Olivecrona]]. 

33. 
Legal positivists who argue that law's validity can be explained by incorporating moral values are labeled inclusive (or soft) legal positivists. 

34. 
His association with natural law is largely due to how he was interpreted by [[Thomas Aquinas]].<ref>Jaffa, ''Thomism and Aristotelianism''.</ref> This was based on Aquinas' conflation of natural law and natural right, the latter of which Aristotle posits in Book V of the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Book IV of the ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]''). 

35. 
The theory can generally be traced to American legal realism and is considered "the first movement in legal theory and legal scholarship in the United States to have espoused a committed Left political stance and perspective".<ref name = Hunt86>Alan Hunt, "The Theory of Critical Legal Studies," Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, Vol.
