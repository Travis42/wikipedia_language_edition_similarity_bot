(tsl?en) Geocentric Coordinate Time, when the Earth's center of the earth, (TCG) is defined as a reference system that moves with the center of the earth (the center of the earth) and is, in principle, used for phenomena on earth and inside the Earth, such as the rotation of the Earth and the motion of the Earth." For the same reason as the Definition of TDB (The SI seconds of TCG are slightly faster than the SI seconds on the earth's surface clock, although the magnitude is much smaller than the previous), here is also defined as the scale version of the TCG, which is equal to SI seconds in the unit of the Earth Level

To match the time and coordinates, you must keep the observer and clock at a standstill in the selected reference system (the <math>v?0 </math>) of the selected reference system, and be infinitely away from the gravity mass in the reference system (conditions that cannot be achieved in reality) so that the gravity bit of the system is at the observer's position of zero (the U-<math>-0 </math>)
