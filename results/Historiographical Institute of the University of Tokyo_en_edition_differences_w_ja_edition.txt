en edition's differences with the ja version: 


1. 

=== ''Dai-Nihon komonjo'' full-text database ===

This database corresponds to the ''Dai-Nihon komonjo'' described above, a supplement to the ''Dai-Nihon shiryō''. 

2. 
* ''Shiryō hensan-jo shozō shozōga mohon'' ([[portrait]]) database
** This is a portrait database of people from that spans from the 9th century until the 19th century. 

3. 
This collection primarily consists of [[primary sources]], but also includes [[secondary sources]], interpretative essays, and even fictional accounts when no other sources can be found. 

4. 

The ''Dai-Nihon komonjo'' is a still-to-be-completed, 193+ volume supplement to the ''Dai-Nihon shiryō''. 

5. 

The ''Dai-Nihon shiryō'' and ''Dai-Nihon komonjo'', are the two largest compilations ever produced in Japan. 

6. 
Institute members have been working on the ''Dai-Nihon shiryō'' ever since the foundation of the Shiryō hensan-jo in 1869; many of the Institute's publications (listed in the link above) are simply companions to the ''Dai-Nihon shiryō'' such as the ''Shiryō sōran'', which is a chronological list of historical events that are used to categorize material in the ''Dai-Nihon shiryō''. 

7. 

== Online Databases ==

The online databases of the Historiographical Institute correspond to many of its publications. 

8. 
Below is a description of the two major databases, plus two important visual image databases. 

9. 

=== ''Dai-Nihon shiryō'' database ===

Among the many specialized databases covering all periods of pre-modern Japanese history, the most important database is the ''Dai-Nihon shiryō'' database that corresponds to the mammoth, still-to-be-completed ''Dai-Nihon shiryō'' described above. 

10. 
Though most of the work focuses on the pre-modern period, historians of the Historiographical Institute have also done extensive work with regard to Meiji documents. 

11. 

== Library ==

The library of the Historiographical Institute consists of over four hundred thousand items. 

12. 
It is important to note that the compilation of works was not limited to Japanese sources, but also included the compilation and translation of Western works as well—works which have had a vital role in shaping the nature of the history field in modern Japan. 

13. 

== ''Dictionary of Sources of Classical Japan (DSCJ)'' ==

Though it is still in draft form, the ''[[Dictionary of Sources of Classical Japan]]'' is an excellent resource for finding definitions and terms from pre-modern Japanese history and literature.

16. 

In 1895, the University decided to resume the work under the name ''Shiryō hensan-kakari,'' attached to the [[Faculty (division)|Faculty]] of Letters, limiting the role of the Historiographical Institute to compilation of historical materials, rather than the creation of a [[nation]]al history—the role that the Institute has today.

* 3-1, Hongo 7-chōme

The {{nihongo|'''Historiographical Institute, the [[University of Tokyo]]'''|東京大学史料編纂所|''Tōkyō daigaku shiryō hensan-jo''}} is a [[research]] institution affiliated with the University of Tokyo that is devoted to the analysis, compilation, and publication of historical source materials concerning [[Japan]]. 

21. 
After several reorganizations, this office was transferred to Tokyo Imperial University in 1888; but in 1893, the Minister of Education terminated the work because of conflict between the government and the institute members over the aims and goals of history (also known as [[Kume affair|the Kume Kunitake Affair]], named after the historian, [[Kume Kunitake]], who was expelled from the Historiographical Institute for writing an article that challenged the customs of [[State Shinto]], and was known for advocating a more "Western," [[scientific]] approach to history). 

22. 
It is divided into three subseries, 1.) ''Hennen monjo'', which includes documents from the 8th century; 2.)''Iewake monjo'', which comprises archival collections of families, temples, or [[shrines]] during the period covered by the ''Dai-Nihon shiryô''; and 3.) ''[[Bakumatsu]] gaikoku kankei monjo'', which includes documents relating to Japan's foreign relations in the Bakumatsu period from 1853 to 1868. 

23. 
Presently, the research staff consists of sixteen professors, seventeen associate professors, and twenty-three research associates.

An official government office of historiography known as the ''Shushi-kan'' (House of Historical Compilation) was formed in order to work on a national history, the ''Dai-Nihon hennenshi'' (Chronological History of Great Japan), which later became part of the ''[[Dai Nihon Shiryō|Dai-Nihon shiryō]]'' (described below).
