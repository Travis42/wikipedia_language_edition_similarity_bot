Mixed bathing
Guidebook to Hakone from 1811

Traditionally, men and women bathed together at both onsens and sentōs, but gender separation has been enforced since the opening of Japan to the West during the Meiji Restoration.

Indoor onsen at Asamushi Onsen

Traditionally, onsens were located outdoors, although many inns have now built indoor bathing facilities as well. 

6. 
Nowadays, as most households have their own bath, the number of traditional public baths has decreased[2], but the number of sightseeing hot spring towns has increased (most notable ones including Kinosaki Onsen, Togura Kamiyamada Onsen [ja], and Akanko Onsen [ja]).

Some examples of types of onsen include:

    Sulphur onsen (硫黄泉, iō-sen)
    Sodium chloride onsen (ナトリウム泉, natoriumu-sen)
    Hydrogen carbonate onsen (炭酸泉, tansan-sen)
    Iron onsen (鉄泉, tetsu-sen)

Risks

Although millions of Japanese bathe in onsens every year with few noticeable side effects, there are still potential side effects to onsen usage, such as aggravating high blood pressure or heart disease.

Notes

    In very isolated onsen, where there is no possibility to use soap before entering in the bath, onsen users are expected to at least rinse their body with the water of the bath before entering it. 

11. 
When the onsen water contains distinctive minerals or chemicals, the onsen establishments typically display what type of water it is.
