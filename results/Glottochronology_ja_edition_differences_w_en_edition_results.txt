In linguistic chronology, the [[lexical statistics] method is used, but lexical statistics does not necessarily require the assumption that "basic vocabulary changes at a relatively constant rate." It is also methodologically different from [Comparative linguistics], which reveals the law of change by comparing languages in [phonology] and [grammar]] to clarify the law of change
