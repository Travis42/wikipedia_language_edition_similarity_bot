If we compare this with the partition function <math>\scriptstyle Z\ =\ \operatorname{Tr}\ e^{-\beta H}</math>  we see that to get the [[partition function (quantum field theory)|partition function]] from the transition amplitudes we can replace <math>\scriptstyle t\,=\,\beta/i</math>, set ''F''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''I''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n'' and sum over ''n''

Since the Fourier transform of a function typically shows up as its inverse, the point particles of statistical mechanics become, under a Fourier transform, the infinitely extended harmonic oscillators of quantum field theory.<ref>Uwe-Jens Wiese, [http://www.wiese.itp.unibe.ch/lectures/fieldtheory.pdf "Quantum Field Theory"], Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Bern, 21 August 2007, page 63.</ref> The [[Green's function]] of an inhomogeneous linear differential operator, defined on a domain with specified initial conditions or boundary conditions, is its impulse response, and mathematically we define the point particles of statistical mechanics as Dirac delta functions, which is to say impulses

The equations of the quantum field can be obtained by taking the Fourier transform of the equations of statistical mechanics

With all such singularities removed from the Universe it thus can have no boundary and Stephen Hawking has speculated that "the [[boundary condition]] to the Universe may be that it has no boundary"

The connection between statistical mechanics and quantum field theory is also seen in the transition amplitude <math>\scriptstyle\langle F\mid e^{-itH}\mid I\rangle </math> between an initial state ''I'' and a final state&nbsp;''F'', where ''H''&nbsp;is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of that system

Finally by using a Wick rotation one can show that the Euclidean [[quantum field theory]] in (''D''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-dimensional spacetime is nothing but [[quantum statistical mechanics]] in ''D''-dimensional space

== In cosmology ==
In the [[Minkowski spacetime]] model adopted by the [[theory of relativity]], spacetime is represented as a four-dimensional surface or manifold

Any boundary to spacetime is a form of singularity, where the smooth nature of spacetime breaks down

Mathematically this is equivalent to writing 

:<math>d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + (it)^2</math>

In this context, <math>i</math> may be either accepted as a feature of the relationship between space and real time, as above, or it may alternatively be incorporated into time itself, such that the value of <math>t</math> is itself an [[imaginary number]], and the equation rewritten in normalised form:

:<math>d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2</math>

Similarly its [[four vector]] may then be written as
:<math>( x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3 )</math>
where distances are represented as <math>x_n</math>, <math>c</math> is the [[velocity of light]] and <math>x_0 = ict</math>

In fact, the names "real" and "imaginary" for numbers are just a historical accident, much like the names "[[rational number|rational]]" and "[[irrational number|irrational]]":
{{quote|...the words ''real'' and ''imaginary'' are picturesque relics of an age when the nature of [[complex number]]s was not properly understood.|||[[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H.S.M
