The term 'pink tide' ({{lang-es|link=no|marea rosa}}, {{lang-pt|onda rosa}}) or 'turn to the Left' (Sp.: ''vuelta hacia la izquierda'', Pt.: ''Guinada à Esquerda'') are phrases used in contemporary 21st century [[Political science|political analysis]] in the media and elsewhere to describe the perception that [[leftism|leftist]] ideology in general, and [[left-wing politics]] in particular, were increasingly becoming influential in Latin America.<ref name="bbc4">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4311957.stm|title=South America's leftward sweep|author=BBC News Americas |date=|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref name="pitts">[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516065906/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_310062.html Pittsburg Tribune-Herald: Latin America's 'pragmatic' pink tide]</ref><ref name="boston">{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/01/14/the_many_stripes_of_anti_americanism/|title=The many stripes of anti-Americanism – The Boston Globe|author=|date=|work=boston.com}}</ref>

===A turn to the left===

According to the BBC, a "common element of the 'pink tide' is a clean break with what was known at the outset of the 1990s as the '[[Washington consensus]]', the mixture of [[open market]]s and [[privatisation]] pushed by the United States".<ref name="bbc4"/> According to Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, a pink tide president herself, [[Hugo Chávez]] of Venezuela (inaugurated 1999), [[Lula da Silva]] of Brazil (inaugurated 2003) and [[Evo Morales]] of Bolivia (inaugurated 2006) were "the three musketeers" of the left in South America.<ref name=VICEtideTURN>{{cite news|last1=Noel|first1=Andrea|title=The Year the 'Pink Tide' Turned: Latin America in 2015 {{!}} VICE News |url= https://news.vice.com/article/the-year-the-pink-tide-turned-latin-america-in-2015|accessdate=30 December 2015|work=[[Vice News|VICE News]]|date=29 December 2015|language=en-US}}</ref> By 2005, the [[BBC]] reported that out of 350 million people in South America, three out of four of them lived in countries ruled by "left-leaning [[President (government title)|presidents]]" elected during the preceding six years.<ref name="bbc4"/>

Despite the presence of a number of Latin American governments which profess to embrace a leftist ideology, it is difficult to categorize Latin American states "according to dominant political tendencies, like a [[Red states and blue states|red-blue post-electoral map of the United States]]."<ref name="ips">{{cite web|url=http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/3806 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 24, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910093646/http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/3806 |archivedate=September 10, 2009 }} Institute for Policy Studies: Latin America's Pink Tide?</ref> According to the [[Institute for Policy Studies]], a [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[think-tank]] based in Washington, D.C.: "a deeper analysis of elections in Ecuador, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Mexico indicates that the "pink tide" interpretation—that a diluted trend leftward is sweeping the continent—may be insufficient to understand the complexity of what's really taking place in each country and the region as a whole".<ref name="ips"/>

While this political shift is difficult to quantify, its effects are widely noticed.
