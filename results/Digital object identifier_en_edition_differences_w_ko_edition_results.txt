Digital object identifier
en edition's differences with the ko version: 
-5.57435e-09
The "10." part of the prefix distinguishes the handle as part of the DOI namespace, as opposed to some other Handle System namespace,{{efn-ua|Other registries are identified by other strings at the start of the prefix
-2.86218e-09

A DOI name does not depend on the object's location and, in this way, is similar to a [[Uniform Resource Name]] (URN) or PURL but differs from an ordinary URL
-2.91493e-10
It requires an additional layer of administration for defining DOI as a URN namespace (the string {{code|urn:doi:10.1000/1}} rather than the simpler {{code|doi:10.1000/1}}) and an additional step of unnecessary redirection to access the resolution service, already achieved through either http proxy or native resolution

==Nomenclature and syntax {{anchor|Prefix|Suffix}}==
A DOI is a type of Handle System handle, which takes the form of a [[character string]] divided into two parts, a prefix and a suffix, separated by a slash
9.23478e-10
To the Handle System, a DOI name is a handle, and so has a set of values assigned to it and may be thought of as a record that consists of a group of fields
3.52811e-09
* Research datasets through [[Datacite]], a consortium of leading research libraries, technical information providers, and scientific data centers;
* [[European Union]] official publications through the [[Publications Office (European Union)|EU publications office]];
* The [[CNKI|Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure]] project at [[Tsinghua University]] and the Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of China (ISTIC), two initiatives sponsored by the Chinese government
4.19618e-09

The names can refer to objects at varying levels of detail: thus DOI names can identify a journal, an individual issue of a journal, an individual article in the journal, or a single table in that article
4.7127e-09
Other "identifier systems" may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include [[Persistent Uniform Resource Locator]] (PURL), URLs, [[Globally Unique Identifier]]s (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme

the [https://www.handle.net/firefox_hdlclient.html CNRI Handle Extension for Firefox], enables the browser to access Handle System handles or DOIs like <code>hdl:4263537/4000</code> or <code>doi:10.1000/1</code> directly in the [[Firefox]] browser, using the native Handle System protocol

==Resolution==
DOI name resolution is provided through the [[Handle System]], developed by [[Corporation for National Research Initiatives]], and is freely available to any user encountering a DOI name
0.193978
This service is unusual in that it tries to find a [[paywall|non-paywalled]] version of a title and redirects you to that instead of the publisher's version.<ref name="capsh">{{cite web|url=http://doai.io/|title=DOAI|publisher=CAPSH (Committee for the Accessibility of Publications in Sciences and Humanities)|accessdate=6 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Schonfeld| first = Roger C.| title = Co-opting 'Official' Channels through Infrastructures for Openness |work = The Scholarly Kitchen| accessdate = 17 October 2016| date = 3 March 2016| url = https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/03/03/coopting-official-channels/}}</ref> Since then, other open-access favoring DOI resolvers have been created, notably https://oadoi.org/ in October 2016.<ref name="impactstory">{{cite web| last=Piwowar| first=Heather| title=Introducing oaDOI: resolve a DOI straight to OA |url=http://blog.impactstory.org/introducting-oadoi/ |date= 25 October 2016 |accessdate=17 March 2017 }}</ref> While traditional DOI resolvers solely rely on the Handle System, alternative DOI resolvers first consult open access resources such as [[BASE (search engine)|BASE]] (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine).<ref name="capsh"/><ref name="impactstory"/>

An alternative to HTTP proxies is to use one of a number of add-ons and plug-ins for [[Web browser|browser]]s, thereby avoiding the conversion of the DOIs to URLs,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.doi.org/tools.html|title=DOI System Tools}}</ref> which depend on domain names and may be subject to change, while still allowing the DOI to be treated as a normal hyperlink

The DOI name-resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes, so that users communicate with it in the same way as with any other web service; it is built on [[open architecture]]s, incorporates [[Computational trust|trust mechanisms]], and is engineered to operate reliably and flexibly so that it can be adapted to changing demands and new applications of the DOI system.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://arstechnica.com/science/2010/03/dois-and-their-discontents-1/|title= DOIs and their discontents|last= Timmer|first= John|date= 6 March 2010|work= [[Ars Technica]]|accessdate= 5 March 2013}}</ref> DOI name-resolution may be used with [[OpenURL]] to select the most appropriate among multiple locations for a given object, according to the location of the user making the request.<ref>{{Cite journal|first1= Susanne|last1= DeRisi|first2= Rebecca|last2= Kennison|first3= Nick|last3= Twyman|title= Editorial: The what and whys of DOIs|journal= [[PLoS Biology]]|volume= 1|issue= 2|page= e57|date= 2003|doi= 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000057|pmid= 14624257|pmc= 261894}} {{open access}}</ref> However, despite this ability, the DOI system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users to non-free copies of documents that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations.<ref>{{Cite book|contribution= Open access to scientific and technical information: the state of the art|first= Jack|last= Franklin|title= Open access to scientific and technical information: state of the art and future trends|editor1-first= Herbert|editor1-last= Grüttemeier|editor2-first= Barry|editor2-last= Mahon|publisher= IOS Press|date= 2003|page= 74|url= https://books.google.com/?id=2X3gW1lUvN4C&pg=PA74|isbn= 978-1-58603-377-4}}</ref>

The [[indecs Content Model]] as used within the DOI system associates metadata with objects
0.215666

Another approach, which avoids typing or [[cut-and-paste|cutting-and-pasting]] into a resolver is to include the DOI in a document as a URL which uses the resolver as an HTTP proxy, such as <code><nowiki>https://doi.org/</nowiki></code> (preferred)<ref>{{cite web|author1=International DOI Foundation|title=Resolution|url=https://doi.org/doi_handbook/3_Resolution.html#3.7.3|website=DOI Handbook|accessdate=19 March 2015|date=7 August 2014}}</ref> or <code><nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/</nowiki></code>, both of which support HTTPS

DOI is not registered as a URN namespace, despite fulfilling all the functional requirements, since URN registration appears to offer no advantage to the DOI System

===Display===
The official ''DOI Handbook'' explicitly states that DOIs should display on screens and in print in the format <code>doi:10.1000/182</code>.<ref name="C4WDefault-2811140">{{cite web |url=https://doi.org/doi_handbook/2_Numbering.html#2.6.1 |title=DOI Handbook – Numbering |date=13 February 2014 |accessdate=30 June 2014 |work=doi.org |author1=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630181440/http://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/2_Numbering.html |archivedate=30 June 2014 |url-status=live |at=Section 2.6.1 Screen and print presentation}}</ref>

Contrary to the ''DOI Handbook'', [[CrossRef]], a major DOI registration agency, recommends displaying a URL (for example, <code><nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1000/182</nowiki></code>) instead of the officially specified format (for example, <code>[https://doi.org/10.1000/182 doi:10.1000/182]</code>)<ref>{{cite web| title=DOI Display Guidelines|url=http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/doi_display_guidelines.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=New Crossref DOI display guidelines are on the way|url=http://blog.crossref.org/2016/09/new-crossref-doi-display-guidelines.html}}</ref> This URL is persistent (there is a contract that ensures persistence in the DOI.ORG domain), so it is a [[Persistent uniform resource locator|PURL]] – providing the location of an [[HTTP proxy]] server which will redirect web accesses to the correct online location of the linked item.<ref name="dd"/><ref>{{Cite journal | first=Andy |last=Powell |title=Resolving DOI Based URNs Using Squid: An Experimental System at UKOLN |journal = D-Lib Magazine|date=June 1998|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/june98/06powell.html| issn=1082-9873}}</ref>

The CrossRef recommendation is primarily based on the assumption that the DOI is being displayed without being hyperlinked to its appropriate URL – the argument being that without the hyperlink it is not as easy to copy-and-paste the full URL to actually bring up the page for the DOI, thus the entire URL should be displayed, allowing people viewing the page containing the DOI to copy-and-paste the URL, by hand, into a new window/tab in their [[Web browser|browser]] in order to go to the appropriate page for the document the DOI represents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crossref.org/news/2011-08-02-crossref-revises-doi-display-guidelines/|title=Crossref Revises DOI Display Guidelines - Crossref|last=ChrissieCW|website=www.crossref.org}}</ref>

==Applications==
Major applications of the DOI system currently include:
* [[Scientific literature|Scholarly materials]] (journal articles, books, ebooks, etc.) through CrossRef, a consortium of around 3,000 publishers; [[Airiti]], a leading provider of electronic academic journals in Chinese and Taiwanese; and the Japan Link Center (JaLC) an organization providing link management and DOI assignment for electronic academic journals in Japanese

Registration agencies, appointed by the IDF, provide services to DOI registrants: they allocate DOI prefixes, register DOI names, and provide the necessary infrastructure to allow registrants to declare and maintain metadata and state data

DOI and other special identifiers can help to unify information about references with different spelling in various language versions of Wikipedia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lewoniewski |first1=Włodzimierz |last2=Węcel |first2=Krzysztof |last3=Abramowicz |first3=Witold |date=23 September 2017 |title=Analysis of References Across Wikipedia Languages |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320041870_Analysis_of_References_Across_Wikipedia_Languages |journal=Communications in Computer and Information Science |volume=756 |pages=561–573 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-67642-5_47 |access-date=2018-05-06 }}</ref>

==Features and benefits ==
The IDF designed the DOI system to provide a form of [[Persistent identifier|persistent identification]], in which each DOI name permanently and unambiguously identifies the object to which it is associated
0.228748

The DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, whereas its location and other metadata may change
