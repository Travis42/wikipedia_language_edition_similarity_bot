  Warming to his theme, Wehler attributed the sales success of the book in Germany to a "deep seated need [on the part of German readers], no longer so constrained by the taboos characteristic of the later twentieth century, to free themselves from the burdensome allegations of national war guilt"<ref>"ein tiefsitzendes, jetzt wieder hochgespültes apologetisches Bedürfnis", der Deutschen "sich von den Schuldvorwürfen zu befreien"</ref><ref>[[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]]: ''Beginn einer neuen Epoche der Weltkriegsgeschichte.''

That doesn’t mean that the Russians should be ‘blamed’ for the outbreak of war.

 Clark dismisses Grey’s attempts as “half-hearted” and founded on a “partisan indifference to the power-political realities of Austro-Hungary’s situation”.

Fischer prompted the ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' ("primacy of domestic politics") school, emphasizing domestic German political factors.

To Bogdanor the rejection of the options of the four power conference and the court of arbitration weigh heavily against Germany and Austria-Hungary when looking for the causes of the war.<ref name=bogdanor />

[[Sean McMeekin]], in his books The Russian Origins of the First World War and July 1914, also places more emphasis on Russian actions and in particular Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Sazonov]]’s bellicosity and duplicity. 

7. 
Taylor argued that by engaging in an arms race and having the general staffs develop elaborate [[railroad|railway]] timetables for mobilization, the continental powers hoped to develop a deterrent that would lead to other powers seeing the risk of war as too dangerous. 

8. 
In Taylor's opinion, none of the great powers wanted a war but all of the great powers wished to increase their power relative to the others.

According to [[Annika Mombauer]] in 2015, a new consensus among scholars had emerged by the 1980s, mainly as a result of Fischer’s intervention:
:Few historians agreed wholly with his [Fischer's] thesis of a premeditated war to achieve aggressive foreign policy aims, but it was generally accepted that Germany’s share of responsibility was larger than that of the other great powers.<ref>Annika Mombauer, "Guilt or Responsibility.

In a 1967 essay "The Primacy of Domestic Politics", Mayer made a ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' ("primacy of domestic politics") argument for the war's origins.

Mayer rejected the traditional ''Primat der Außenpolitik'' ("primacy of foreign politics") argument of diplomatic history, because it failed to take into account that all of the major European countries were in a "revolutionary situation" in 1914.<ref name=Mayer1997>Mayer, Arno, "The Primacy of Domestic Politics", pages 42-47 from ''The Outbreak of World I'', edited by Holger Herwig.

Changes in historical arguments over time are in part related to the delayed availability of classified historical archives.

 I think Grey would have taken the Austrian side and would have said concessions were needed by Serbia to keep the peace…and it would have been very difficult for the Russians not to go along with that."<ref name=bogdanor>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ubDPVLZ2iE Britain and 1914 - Professor Vernon Bogdanor 46mins], YouTube.</ref> The Russians further proposed that the conflict be subject to the court of arbitration in the Hague but this too was rejected by Germany and Austria-Hungary.

The Russians were the first great power to issue an order of general mobilisation and the first Russo-German clash took place on German, not on Russian soil, following the Russian invasion of East Prussia.

Fischer alleged the German government hoped to use external expansion and aggression to check internal dissent and democratization. 

17. 
Hillgruber argued that the Germans hoped that both [[Paris]] and [[London]] would decide the crisis in the Balkans did not concern them and that lack of Anglo-French support would lead the Russians to reach an understanding with Germany. 

18. 
 Moreover he highlights that Sazanov deliberately lied to the British about Russia’s mobilisation, rendering the British unable to restrain their entente partner through ignorance of the advanced state of their military preparations.

===Opposition to the Fischer thesis===
The "Berlin War Party" thesis and variants of it, blaming domestic German political factors, became something of an orthodoxy in the years after publication.

In any case, Fischer would then be completely in the right when he denies that Bethmann seriously wanted to avoid war...If what in your view, [[Kurt Riezler|Riezler]]'s diary reveals is correct, I would have to discard my article, instead of publishing it...In any case we are dealing here with a most ominous [''unheimlichen''] state secret, and all historical perspectives are displaced [''verschieben sich''], since...Bethmann Hollweg's September Program then appears in a wholly different light".<ref>Fischer, Fritz "Twenty-Five Years Later: Looking Back on the "Fischer Controversy" and Its Consequences" pages 207-223 from ''Central European History'', Volume 21, Issue 3, 1988 page 210.</ref></blockquote>

Trachtenberg concluded in 1991:
:It is certainly not true, however, that the views of the Fischer school have come to be almost universally shared, either inside Germany or out. 

22. 
Hillgruber argued that when the Austrian attack on Serbia caused Russia to mobilize instead of backing down, the German Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] under strong pressure from a hawkish General Staff led by General [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger|Moltke the Younger]] panicked and ordered the [[Schlieffen Plan]] to be activated, thus leading to a German attack on France. 

23. 
When the crisis began in the summer of 1914, the need to mobilize faster than potential opponents made the leaders of 1914 prisoners of their logistics. 

24. 
In Germany these tended to deflect blame, while in Allied countries they tended to blame Germany or Austria-Hungary.

==The Fischer thesis==
In 1961, the German historian [[Fritz Fischer]] published the controversial ''[[Germany's Aims in the First World War|Griff nach der Weltmacht]]'', in which Fischer argued that the German government had an [[expansionist]] foreign policy, formulated in the aftermath of [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic]] gains in the election of 1912 and had started a [[war of aggression]] in 1914.

One championed by the West German historian [[Andreas Hillgruber]] argued that in 1914, a "calculated risk" on the part of Berlin had gone awry.<ref>Hillgruber, Andreas ''Germany and the Two World Wars'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1981 pages 26 & 30–31.</ref> Hillgruber argued that what the [[German Empire|Imperial German government]] had attempted to do in 1914 was to break the informal Triple Entente of Russia, France and Britain by encouraging Austria-Hungary to invade Serbia and thus provoke a crisis in an area that would concern only [[St.

He thought that the German military leadership, in the midst of a European arms race, believed that they would be unable to further expand the German army without extending the officer corps beyond the traditional [[Prussian aristocracy]].

Regarding historians inside Germany, she adds that by the 1990s, "There was 'a far-reaching consensus about the special responsibility of the German Reich' in the writings of leading historians, though they differed in how they weighted Germany’s role.<ref>Mombauer, p.

   Germany also rejected the proposal on the grounds that they believed only Germany would support their ally.

In 1919, the German diplomat and former Chancellor [[Bernhard von Bülow]] went through the German archives to suppress any documents that might show that Germany was responsible for the war and to ensure that only documents that were exculpatory (favorable to the defendant, in this case, Germany) might be seen by historians.<ref name=Patriotic>Herwig, Holger.
