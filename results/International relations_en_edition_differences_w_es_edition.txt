1. 
Examples are [[John Foster Dulles]]' position regarding the Soviet Union, or Israel's initial position on the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]].<ref>"...the most widely studied is the inherent bad faith model of one's opponent", The handbook of social psychology, Volumes 1–2, edited by Daniel T. 

2. 
Unlike prior, shorter-term blocs, the Western and Soviet blocs sought to spread their national ideological differences to other nations. 

3. 

During the late 1980s and the 1990s, debate between positivists and post-positivists became the dominant debate and has been described as constituting the Third "Great Debate" (Lapid 1989). 

4. 

[[Constructivism in international politics|Constructivism in IR]] can be divided into what [[Ted Hopf]] (1998) calls "conventional" and "critical" constructivism. 

5. 
Post-structuralism explores the deconstruction of concepts traditionally not problematic in IR (such as "power" and "agency") and examines how the construction of these concepts shapes international relations. 

6. 
If on the other hand anarchy is seen as restricted (a "Lockean" anarchy) then a more peaceful system will exist.

"Globalization: The Politics of Global Economic Relations and International Business." Durham: [[Carolina Academic Press]], 2012.</ref> Such a foundation of sovereignty permits, is indicated by a sovereign's obligation to other sovereigns, interdependence and dependence to take place. 

8. 

====Revisionism/status quo====
States can be classified by whether they accept the international [[status quo]], or are revisionist—i.e., want change. 

9. 
However, the growing influence of feminist and women-centric approaches within the international policy communities (for example at the World Bank and the United Nations) is more reflective of the liberal feminist emphasis on equality of opportunity for women. 

10. 
Because feminist IR is linked broadly to the critical project in IR, by and large most feminist scholarship has sought to problematize the politics of knowledge construction within the discipline – often by adopting methodologies of deconstructivism associated with postmodernism/poststructuralism. 

11. 
Feminist IR has not only concerned itself with the traditional focus of IR on states, wars, diplomacy and security, but feminist IR scholars have also emphasized the importance of looking at how gender shapes the current global political economy. 

12. 
Morgenthau's belief in this regard is part of the reason he has been classified as a "classical realist" rather than a realist. 

13. 

===Post-positivist/reflectivist theories===

====Constructivism====
{{Main|Constructivism (international relations)}}
[[Radical constructionism|Social constructivism]] encompasses a broad range of theories that aim to address questions of [[ontology]], such as the [[structure and agency|structure-and-agency]] debate, as well as questions of [[epistemology]], such as the "material/ideational" debate that concerns the relative role of material forces versus ideas. 

14. 
* Religious, ethnic, and secessionist groups{{spaced ndash}} Viewing these aspects of the sub-unit level has explanatory power with regards to [[ethnic conflict]]s, [[religious wars]], transnational [[diaspora]] ([[diaspora politics]]) and other actors which do not consider themselves to fit with the defined state boundaries. 

15. 

====Organisation of Islamic Cooperation====
{{Main|Organisation of Islamic Cooperation}}
The [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) is an [[international organization]] consisting of 57 member states. 

16. 
Examining the role of personalities in the decision making process can have some [[explanatory power]], as can the role of misperception between various actors. 

17. 
While throughout world history there have been instances of groups lacking or losing sovereignty, such as African nations prior to Decolonization or the occupation of Iraq during the [[Iraq War]], there is still a need for sovereignty in terms of assessing international relations. 

18. 
* Science, technology and international relations{{spaced ndash}} How science and technology impact global health, business, environment, technology, and development. 

19. 
It assumes that cooperation is possible in the anarchic system of states, indeed, regimes are by definition, instances of international cooperation. 

20. 
* The mutual exchange of ideas, information, art, music and language among nations through [[cultural diplomacy]] has also been recognized by governments as an important tool in the development of international relations.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xAgkDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=cultural+diplomacy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAmeT22rbeAhUCc98KHaLzCW4Q6AEIVzAI#v=onepage&q=cultural%20diplomacy&f=false ''Music, Art and Diplomacy East-West cultural Interactions and the Cold War''] Editors: Siom Mukkonen & Pekka Suutari. 

21. 

====Sovereignty====
{{main|Westphalian sovereignty}}
Preceding the concepts of interdependence and dependence, international relations relies on the idea of sovereignty. 

22. 
Here, the concepts of balancing (rising in power to counter another) and bandwagonning (siding with another) are developed. 

23. 
The organisation attempts to be the collective voice of the [[Muslim world]] (Ummah) and attempts to safeguard the interests and ensure the progress and well-being of [[Muslims]]. 

24.

* The allotment of economic and/or diplomatic benefits such as the [[European Union]]'s [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement policy]]; candidate countries are only allowed to join if they meet the [[Copenhagen criteria]]. 

27. 
This is mostly done by the large human rights NGOs such as [[Amnesty International]] (for instance when it called Guantanamo Bay a "Gulag"),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/POL10/014/2005/en%3E|title=Error – Amnesty International|website=www.amnesty.org}}</ref> or [[Human Rights Watch]].

====Liberalism====
{{Main|Liberalism (international relations)}}
{{See also|Liberal internationalism}}

According to liberalism, individuals are basically good and capable of meaningful cooperation to promote positive change. 

38. 
This also means that nations are, in essence, free to make their own choices as to how they will go about conducting policy without any [[international organization]]s blocking a nation's right to [[sovereignty]]. 

39. 
Also in Canada, in 2000, [[Peter Munk]] sponsored the formation of the [[Munk School of Global Affairs]], which, with its flagship program the Master of Global Affairs (MGA), considers IR with a particular emphasis on the implications for the private sector. 

40. 

The case of Gilpin proved to be correct and Waltz's article titled "The Stability of a Bipolar World" <ref>Daedalus, 93/3: (1964), 881–909</ref> was followed in 1999 by [[William Wohlforth]]'s article titled "The Stability of a Unipolar World"<ref>International Security, 24/1: (1999), 5–41</ref>

Waltz's thesis can be expressed in [[power transition theory]], which states that it is likely that a [[great power]] would challenge a hegemon after a certain period, resulting in a major war.

[[Japan]] is an example of a state that has gone from being a revisionist state to one that is satisfied with the status quo, because the status quo is now beneficial to it. 

43. 
Liberalism views states, nongovernmental organizations, and intergovernmental organizations as key actors in the international system. 

44. 
An alternative model of the nation-state was developed in reaction to the French republican concept by the Germans and others, who instead of giving the citizenry sovereignty, kept the princes and nobility, but defined nation-statehood in ethnic-linguistic terms, establishing the rarely if ever fulfilled ideal that all people speaking one language should belong to one state only. 

45. 
Different theoretical perspectives treat it in somewhat different fashion. 

46. 

Similarly, [[liberal international relations theory|liberalism]] draws upon the work of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Jean Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], with the work of the former often being cited as the first elaboration of [[democratic peace theory]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Stanford Encyclopedia of philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/|publisher=Stanford press|accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref> Though contemporary human rights is considerably different from the type of rights envisioned under [[natural law]], [[Francisco de Vitoria]], [[Hugo Grotius]] and [[John Locke]] offered the first accounts of universal entitlement to certain rights on the basis of common humanity.

48. 
International relations is an [[academic]] and a [[public policy]] field, and so can be [[Positive statement|positive]] and [[Normative statement|normative]], because it analyses and formulates the [[foreign policy]] of a given state. 

49. 
Many cite [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'' (6th century BC), [[Thucydides]]' ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' (5th century BC), [[Chanakya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'' (4th century BC), as the inspiration for realist theory, with [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' and [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' providing further elaboration. 

50. 

====Interdependence====
Many advocate that the current international system is characterized by growing interdependence; the mutual responsibility and dependency on others. 

51. 
To improve society, it is first necessary to understand the laws by which society lives. 

52. 
Carr's "What is History" was a deliberate critique of positivism, and [[Hans Morgenthau]]'s aim in "Scientific Man vs Power Politics" was to demolish any conception that international politics/power politics can be studied scientifically. 

53. 

====Inherent bad faith model====
{{Further|Bad faith|inherent bad faith model}}
The "[[inherent bad faith model]]" of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by [[Ole Holsti]] to explain the relationship between [[John Foster Dulles]]' beliefs and his model of information processing.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stuart | first1 = Douglas   | last2 = Starr | first2 = Harvey | year = 1981 | title = The 'Inherent Bad Faith Model' Reconsidered: Dulles, Kennedy, and Kissinger | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = 3/4 | pages = 1–33 | jstor = 3791139 | doi = 10.2307/3791139 | url =  | accessdate = }}</ref> It is the most widely studied model of one's opponent.<ref>"...the most widely studied is the inherent bad faith model of one’s opponent...", ''The handbook of social psychology'', Volumes 1-2, edited by Daniel T. 

54. 
Depending on the academic institution, it is either a field of [[political science]], an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] academic field similar to [[global studies]], or an entirely independent academic [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]] in which students take a variety of internationally focused courses in [[social science]] and [[humanities]] disciplines. 

55. 
Additionally, this also includes the individual person as while the individual is what constitutes the states collective entity, the individual does have the potential to also create unpredicted behaviours. 

56. 
IR emerged as a formal [[academic discipline]] in 1919 with the founding of the first IR professorship: the Woodrow Wilson Chair at [[Aberystwyth]], [[University of Wales]] (now [[Aberystwyth University]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/interpol/|title=Aberystwyth University – Department of International Politics|website=www.aber.ac.uk}}</ref> held by [[Alfred Eckhard Zimmern]]<ref name="AAA">{{Cite journal|last=Abadía|first=Adolfo A.|date=2015|title=Del liberalismo al neo-realismo. 

57. 
Described in [[Jean Bodin]]'s "Six Books of the Commonwealth" in 1576, the three pivotal points derived from the book describe sovereignty as being a state, that the sovereign power(s) have absolute power over their territories, and that such a power is only limited by the sovereign's "own obligations towards other sovereigns and individuals".<ref>p. 

58. 
Such a state in which the nation is sovereign would thence be termed a [[nation-state]] (as opposed to a monarchy or a religious state). 

59. 
Group theory argues that although these interest groups are constitutive of the state, they are also causal forces in the exercise of state power. 

60. 

For example, if the system is dominated by states that see anarchy as a life or death situation (what Wendt terms a "Hobbesian" anarchy) then the system will be characterized by warfare. 

61. 

A key difference between the two positions is that while positivist theories, such as neo-realism, offer causal explanations (such as why and how power is exercised), post-positivist theories focus instead on constitutive questions, for instance what is meant by "power"; what makes it up, how it is experienced and how it is reproduced. 

62. 
[[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]], a collaboration between [[Tufts University]] and [[Harvard]], opened its doors in 1933 as the first graduate-only school of international affairs in the United States.<ref>Fletcher History.

Not all approaches to regime theory, however, are liberal or neoliberal; some realist scholars like [[Joseph Grieco]] have developed hybrid theories which take a realist based approach to this fundamentally liberal theory. 

64. 
It is often divided up into the concepts of [[hard power]] and [[soft power]], hard power relating primarily to coercive power, such as the use of force, and soft power commonly covering [[economics]], [[diplomacy]] and [[culture|cultural]] influence.

===Positivist theories===

====Realism====
[[Realism (international relations)|Realism]] focuses on state security and power above all else. 

68. 

====National interest====
Perhaps the most significant concept behind that of power and sovereignty, [[national interest]] is a state's action in relation to other states where it seeks to gain advantage or benefits to itself. 

69. 
The study of war in international relations is covered by the disciplines of "[[war studies]]" and "[[strategic studies]]". 

70. 
While the nation-state system is considered "modern", many states have not incorporated the system and are termed "pre-modern". 

71. 
Marxists view the international system as an integrated capitalist system in pursuit of capital accumulation. 

72. 
Carr]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]] argued that states are self-interested, power-seeking rational actors, who seek to maximize their security and chances of survival.<ref>{{cite book|last=Morganthau|first=Hans|title=Politics Among Nations: The struggle for Power and Peace|year=1978|location=New York|pages=4–15|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/morg6.htm|accessdate=2016-02-24}}</ref> Cooperation between states is a way to maximize each individual state's security (as opposed to more idealistic reasons). 

73. 
Various versions of the theory suggest that this is either an inevitability (standard dependency theory), or use the theory to highlight the necessity for change (Neo-Marxist). 

74. 
The [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] was a concept prevalent in Europe prior to the [[First World War]], the thought being that by balancing power blocs it would create stability and prevent war. 

75. 
(In Europe today, few states conform to either definition of nation-state: many continue to have royal sovereigns, and hardly any are ethnically homogeneous.)

The particular European system supposing the sovereign equality of states was exported to the Americas, Africa, and Asia via [[colonialism]] and the "standards of civilization". 

76. 
Individuals form groups and later, states; states are generally cooperative and tend to follow international norms.<ref name="Mingst, Karen A. 

77. 

====Dependency====
[[File:ISAF soldier looking for enemy positions in Kunar Province of Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|[[NATO]] [[International Security Assistance Force]] in [[Afghanistan]]]]
[[Dependency theory]] is a theory most commonly associated with [[Marxism]], stating that a set of core states exploit a set of weaker periphery states for their prosperity. 

78. 
Realism taught American leaders to focus on interests rather than on ideology, to seek peace through strength, and to recognize that great powers can coexist even if they have antithetical values and beliefs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Globalization of World Politics|last=Baylis|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-956909-0|location=|pages=86–87|quote=|via=}}</ref>

''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', written by [[Thucydides]], is considered a foundational text of the realist school of political philosophy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Norris|first=Cochrane, Charles|title=Thucydides and the Science of History|date=1929|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=179}}</ref> There is debate over whether Thucydides himself was a realist; Ned Lebow has argued that seeing Thucydides as a realist is a misinterpretation of a more complex political message within his work.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lebow|first=Richard Ned|date=2001|title=Thucydides the Constructivist|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=95|issue=3|pages=547–560|jstor=3118232|doi=10.1017/S0003055401003112}}</ref> Amongst others, philosophers like [[Machiavelli]], [[Hobbes]] and [[Rousseau]] are considered to have contributed to the Realist philosophy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baylis|first=John|title=The globalization of world politics : an introduction to international relations|date=2001|publisher=Oxford Univ. 

79. 

Further linked in with Marxist theories is [[dependency theory]] and the [[Core-periphery|core–periphery model]], which argue that developed countries, in their pursuit of power, appropriate developing states through international banking, security and trade agreements and unions on a formal level, and do so through the interaction of political and financial advisors, missionaries, relief aid workers, and MNCs on the informal level, in order to integrate them into the capitalist system, strategically appropriating undervalued natural resources and labor hours and fostering economic and political dependence. 

80. 
Constructivism is not a theory of IR in the manner of neo-realism, but is instead a [[social theory]] which is used to better explain the actions taken by states and other major actors as well as the identities that guide these states and actors.
