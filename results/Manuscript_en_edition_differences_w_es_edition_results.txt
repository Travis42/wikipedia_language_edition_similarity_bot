A '''manuscript''' (abbreviated '''MS''' for singular and '''MSS''' for plural) was, traditionally, any document that is written by hand — or, once practical [[typewriter]]s became available, [[typewritten]] — as opposed to being mechanically [[printing|printed]] or reproduced in some indirect or automated way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manuscript|title=Definition of MANUSCRIPT|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> More recently, the term has come to be understood to further include ''any'' written, typed, or word-processed copy of an author's work, as distinguished from its rendition as a printed version of the same.<ref>{{OED|manuscript}}</ref> Before the arrival of [[printing]], all documents and books were manuscripts

For modern parchment makers and calligraphers, and apparently often in the past, the terms parchment and vellum are used based on the different degrees of quality, preparation and thickness, and not according to which animal the skin came from, and because of this, the more neutral term "membrane" is often used by modern academics, especially where the animal has not been established by testing.<ref name="Intro" />

Because they are books, pre-modern manuscripts are best described using bibliographic rather than archival standards
