Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.

1000 CE – ca.1880 CE. 

4. 
Semi-finished iron or steel bars were marketed in parts of West Africa, such as [Sukur], on the Nigeria-Cameroon border, which in the 19th century exported thousands of bars a year north of the [Lake Chad] basin. 

5. 
It was the natural shooting furnace, which is designed to reach the temperatures needed to form and drain the slag by using a chimney effect: the hot air allows more air to attract through the openings at the base.

7. 
The oldest natural-fire furnaces found are found in Burkina Faso and date back to the 7th and 8th centuries.

Social and Cultural Meanings
It is important to recognize that while iron production had a great influence on both the trade and cultural expansion of Africa, <ref>Martinelli, 1993 pp.

These techniques are now extinct in all regions of [[Sub-Saharan Africa], with the exception of some very remote regions of [[Ethiopia]] .

Unlike iron smelters in [[Europe], [[India]] or [[China]], African metalworkers did not use water energy to blow bellows in furnaces that were too large to be blown with hand bellows. 

13. 
Linguist Christopher Ehret argues that the first words for working iron in Bantu languages were taken from the languages of Central Sudan, probably somewhere near the modern [Uganda] and [[Kenya]],<ref>Ehret, C. 

14. 
62-64.</ref> Natural-fire furnaces were particularly characteristic of African savannah forests, and were used in two belts: through Saheian forests from [[Senegal] in the west to [[Sudan]] in the east and in the Brachystegia-Julbenardia forests of southern Tanzania, north of [Zimbabwe]] in the east and in the Brachystegia-Julbenardia forests of southern Tanzania, north of [Zimbabwe]. 

15. 
321-361</ref> Any such interpretation is correct, archaeological evidence clearly indicates that iron and cereal agriculture ([mijo]] and [sorgo]) spread from southern [Tanzania] and northern [Zambia]], beginning in the 1st century BC, to the eastern region of Cape Africa, which was reached in the 3rd century.

The nearby site of [[Djenné-Djenno]] of the [Niger River] Niger Valley]] between [[Mali]] and [[Nigeria]] shows evidence of iron production of around 250&nbsp;a.&nbsp;C.

The tools for cultivation and agriculture made production much more efficient and possible on much larger scales.

22. 
A much wider range of smelting processes has been recorded on the African continent than in other parts of the Old World, probably because "bloomeries"—the type of furnace that was once used to melt iron from its oxides—remained in use in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, while in Europe and most of Asia they were replaced by the [high furnace] before most varieties of "bloomeries" could be registered. 

23. 
65-112.</ref> The large masses of slag – from 10,000 to 60,000 tonnes – noticed in some places in Togo, Burkina Faso and Mali reflect the large expansion of iron production in West Africa after the year 1000, which is associated with the diffusion of natural shooting furnace technology. 

24. 
A third problem is the inherent lack of precision of the radiocarbon method itself in the range of 800 to 400 BC, which is attributable to irregular radiocarbon production in the upper atmosphere.

In short, there is no evidence that iron working technology has been brought through the Sahara to sub-Saharan Africa; there is no evidence of independent invention.
