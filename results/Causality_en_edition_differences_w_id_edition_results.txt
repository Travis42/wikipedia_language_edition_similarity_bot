Some philosophers of history such as [[Arthur Danto]] have claimed that "explanations in history and elsewhere" describe "not simply an event—something that happens—but a change".<ref>Danto, Arthur (1965) ''Analytical Philosophy of History'', 233.</ref> Like many practicing historians, they treat causes as intersecting actions and sets of actions which bring about "larger changes", in Danto's words: to decide "what are the elements which persist through a change" is "rather simple" when treating an individual's "shift in attitude", but "it is considerably more complex and metaphysically challenging when we are interested in such a change as, say, the break-up of feudalism or the emergence of nationalism".<ref>Danto, Arthur (1965) ''Analytical Philosophy of History'', 249.</ref>

Much of the historical debate about causes has focused on the relationship between communicative and other actions, between singular and repeated ones, and between actions, structures of action or group and institutional contexts and wider sets of conditions.<ref>Hewitson, Mark (2014) ''History and Causality'', 86–116.</ref> [[John Lewis Gaddis|John Gaddis]] has distinguished between exceptional and general causes (following [[Marc Bloch]]) and between "routine" and "distinctive links" in causal relationships: "in accounting for what happened at Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, we attach greater importance to the fact that President Truman ordered the dropping of an atomic bomb than to the decision of the Army Air Force to carry out his orders."<ref>Gaddis, John L

First, the variable <math>x_j</math> may be a non-economic variable: for example, if rainfall amount <math>x_j</math> is hypothesized to affect the futures price ''y'' of some agricultural commodity, it is impossible that in fact the futures price affects rainfall amount (provided that cloud seeding is never attempted)

In the English language, as distinct from Aristotle's own language, [[Aristotelian philosophy]] uses the word "cause" to mean "explanation" or "answer to a 'why' question", including [[Aristotle]]'s material, formal, efficient, and final "causes"; then the "cause" is the [[Explanandum|explanans]] for the [[explanandum]]

3.16413e-09
the ratio 2:1 and number in general is the cause of the octave—and the parts of the formula [i.e., the '''formal cause''']
3.16413e-09
the man who plans is a cause, and the father is the cause of the child, and in general that which produces is the cause of that which is produced, and that which changes of that which is changed [i.e., the '''efficient cause''']
3.16413e-09
"To be healthy", we say, and by saying this we consider that we have supplied the cause [the '''final cause''']

====After the Middle Ages====
<!--[[David Hume]] links here-->
{{See also|Humean definition of causality}}
For Aristotelian philosophy before Aquinas, the word cause had a broad meaning
3.21188e-09
Formally, P{''B''|''A''}≥ P{''B''} where P{''B''|''A''} is the conditional probability that ''B'' will occur given the information that ''A'' occurred, and P{''B''}is the probability that ''B'' will occur having no knowledge whether ''A'' did or did not occur
3.48689e-09
 For example, if ''A'' denotes the event "The person is a smoker," ''B'' denotes the event "The person now has or will have cancer at some time in the future" and ''C'' denotes the event "The person now has or will have emphysema some time in the future," then the following three relationships hold: P{''B''|''A''} ≥ P{''B''}, P{''C''|''A''} ≥ P{''C''} and P{''B''|''C''} ≥ P{''B''}
4.08977e-09
Properly speaking, the hypothesized cause and the hypothesized effect are each temporally transient processes
4.20459e-09
But he did not have the understanding that came with knowledge of [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|Minkowski geometry]] and the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]], that the notion of causality can be used as a prior foundation from which to [[Causal structure|construct notions]] of time and space.<ref name=Robb1911/><ref name=Whitehead1929/><ref name=Malament/>

====Ontology====
A general metaphysical question about cause and effect is what kind of entity can be a cause, and what kind of entity can be an effect
4.29827e-09
 With a threads and cloth metaphors, three causes are:
	
# Co-inherence cause: resulting from substantial contact, 'substantial causes', threads are substantial to cloth, corresponding to Aristotle's material cause
5.32488e-09
So, given a system of equations, and a set of variables appearing in these equations, we can introduce an asymmetric relation among individual equations and variables that corresponds perfectly to our commonsense notion of a causal ordering
5.37602e-09
Definition and meaning}}</ref> where the cause is partly responsible for the effect, and the effect is partly dependent on the cause
7.1791e-09
Second, the [[instrumental variables]] technique may be employed to remove any reverse causation by introducing a role for other variables (instruments) that are known to be unaffected by the dependent variable
7.1791e-09

Regression analysis controls for other relevant variables by including them as regressors (explanatory variables)
7.26322e-09
The presence of ''x'', however, does not imply that ''y'' will occur.<ref name="CR">{{Cite web

;Sufficient causes: If ''x'' is a sufficient cause of ''y'', then the presence of ''x'' necessarily implies the subsequent occurrence of ''y''
9.05857e-09
Thus the presence of ''y'' does not imply the prior occurrence of ''x''.<ref name="CR"/>
;Contributory causes: For some specific effect, in a singular case, a factor that is a contributory cause is one among several co-occurrent causes
1.01354e-08
In general, a factor that is a contributory cause is not sufficient, because it is by definition accompanied by other causes, which would not count as causes if it were sufficient
1.16488e-08
That is to say, it would make good sense grammatically to say either "''A'' is the cause and ''B'' the effect" or "''B'' is the cause and ''A'' the effect", though only one of those two can be actually true
1.2089e-08
(1971) ''Explanation and Understanding.'' [[Cornell University Press]].</ref> Under these theories, ''x'' causes ''y'' only in the case that one can change ''x'' in order to change ''y''
1.40594e-08
(2002), ''The Landscape of History: How Historians Map the Past'', 95.</ref> For his part, Christopher Lloyd puts forward four "general concepts of causation" used in history:  the "metaphysical idealist concept, which asserts that the phenomena of the universe are products of or emanations from an omnipotent being or such final cause"; "the empiricist (or Humean) regularity concept, which is based on the idea of causation being a matter of constant conjunctions of events"; "the functional/teleological/consequential concept", which is "goal-directed, so that goals are causes"; and the "realist, structurist and dispositional approach, which sees relational structures and internal dispositions as the causes of phenomena".<ref>Lloyd, Christopher (1993) ''Structures of History'', 159.</ref>

==== Law ====
{{Main|Causation (law)}}
According to [[law]] and [[jurisprudence]], '''legal cause''' must be demonstrated to hold a [[defendant]] liable for a [[crime]] or a [[tort]] (i.e
1.66219e-08
 In contrast, simultaneous cause and effect rejectors say that if the effect already exists, then it cannot effect the same way again
1.74668e-08
The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects are assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, and actual effects to operating causes
2.18745e-08
This helps to avoid false inferences of causality due to the presence of a third, underlying, variable that influences both the potentially causative variable and the potentially caused variable: its effect on the potentially caused variable is captured by directly including it in the regression, so that effect will not be picked up as an indirect effect through the potentially causative variable of interest

;Perception of launching events
Some researchers such as Anjan Chatterjee at the University of Pennsylvania and Jonathan Fugelsang at the University of Waterloo are using neuroscience techniques to investigate the neural and psychological underpinnings of causal launching events in which one object causes another object to move
0.110432

Psychological research shows that people's thoughts about the causal relationships between events influences their judgments of the plausibility of counterfactual alternatives, and conversely, their [[counterfactual thinking]] about how a situation could have turned out differently changes their judgments of the causal role of events and agents
0.110432
On the other hand, if the null hypothesis that <math>a_j=0</math> cannot be rejected, then equivalently the hypothesis of no causal effect of <math>x_j</math> on ''y'' cannot be rejected

It is hard to quantify this last requirement and thus different authors prefer somewhat different definitions.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Causal calculus===
When experimental interventions are infeasible or illegal, the derivation of cause effect relationship from observational studies must rest on some qualitative theoretical assumptions, for example, that symptoms do not cause diseases, usually expressed in the form of missing arrows in [[causal graphs]] such as [[Bayesian network]]s or [[path analysis (statistics)|path diagrams]]
0.127515
''Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> (also known as do-calculus, Pearl's Causal Calculus, Calculus of
Actions) permits one to infer interventional probabilities from conditional probabilities in causal [[Bayesian network]]s with unmeasured variables
0.145239
Here the notion of causality is one of contributory causality as discussed [[Causality#Necessary and sufficient causes|above]]: If the true value <math>a_j \ne 0</math>, then a change in <math>x_j</math> will result in a change in ''y'' ''unless'' some other causative variable(s), either included in the regression or implicit in the error term, change in such a way as to exactly offset its effect; thus a change in <math>x_j</math> is ''not sufficient'' to change ''y''
0.156174

===Structure learning===
While derivations in causal calculus rely on the structure of the causal graph, parts of the causal structure can, under certain assumptions, be learned from statistical data
0.156174
If the null hypothesis that <math>a_j=0</math> is rejected, then the alternative hypothesis that <math>a_{j} \ne 0 </math> and equivalently that <math>x_j</math> causes ''y'' cannot be rejected

Attempting to reduce causal claims to manipulation requires that manipulation is more basic than causal interaction

'''Causality''' (also referred to as '''causation''',<ref>'The action of causing; the relation of cause and effect' [[OED]]</ref> or '''cause and effect''') is [[wikt:efficacy|efficacy]], by which one process or state, a ''cause'', contributes to the production of another process or state, an ''effect'',<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/causality.html |title = What is causality

These theorists claim that the important concept for understanding causality is not causal relationships or causal interactions, but rather identifying causal processes
0.220863
it is part of the business of philosophy to determine what causal relationships in general are, what it is for one thing to cause another, or what it is for nature to obey causal laws
0.220863

Note that the analysis does not purport to explain how we make causal judgements or how we reason about causation, but rather to give a metaphysical account of what it is for there to be a causal relation between some pair of events

[[Attribution (psychology)|Attribution]] can be external (assigning causality to an outside agent or force—claiming that some outside thing motivated the event) or internal (assigning causality to factors within the person—taking personal [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] or [[accountability]] for one's actions and claiming that the person was directly responsible for the event)
0.255031

Another sort of conditional, the [[counterfactual conditional]], has a stronger connection with causality, yet even counterfactual statements are not all examples of causality
