Despite some disagreements, Kerhaw has called Mommsen a "good personal friend" and an "important further vital stimulus to my own work on Nazism".<ref name="Kershaw 2004"/> Kershaw has argued in his two-volume biography of Hitler that Hitler did play a decisive role in the development of policies of genocide, but also argued that many of the measures that led to the [[Holocaust]] were undertaken by many lower-ranking officials without direct orders from Hitler in the expectation that such steps would win them favour.<ref>Kershaw, Ian ''Hitler 1889–1936 Hubris'', W.

==Structuralist views==
Like Broszat, Kershaw sees the structures of the Nazi state as far more important than the personality of Hitler (or any other individual for that matter) as an explanation for the way [[Nazi Germany]] developed. 

12. 
198–199</ref> Kershaw has argued that the term ''Widerstand'' should be used only for those working for the total overthrow of the Nazi system, and those engaging in behaviour that was counter to the regime's wishes without seeking to overthrow the regime should be included under the terms opposition and dissent, depending upon their motives and actions.<ref>Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold Press, 2000, pp.

Kulka argued that most Germans were more antisemitic than Kershaw portrayed them in ''Popular Opinion and Political Dissent in the Third Reich'', and that rather than "indifference" argued that "passive complicity" would be a better term to describe the reaction of the German people to the ''Shoah''.<ref>Marrus, Michael ''The Holocaust in History'', Toronto: KeyPorter, 2000 p.

In Kershaw's view, the Nazi dictatorship was not a totalitarian monolith, but rather an unstable coalition of several blocs in a "power cartel" comprising the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]], big business, the German state bureaucracy, the Army and [[SS]]/police agencies (and moreover, each of the "power blocs" in turn were divided into several factions).<ref>Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold Press, 2000 p.

Kershaw's assessment that most Bavarians, and by implication Germans, were "indifferent" to the [[the Holocaust|''Shoah'']] faced criticism from the [[Israel]]i historian [[Otto Dov Kulka]] and the Canadian historian [[Michael Hans Kater|Michael Kater]]. 

19. 
Citing the work of the American historian [[Christopher Browning]] in his biography of Hitler, Kershaw argues that in the period 1939–41 the phrase "Final Solution to the Jewish Question" was a "territorial solution", that such plans as the [[Nisko Plan]] and [[Madagascar Plan]] were serious and only in the latter half of 1941 did the phrase "Final Solution" come to refer to genocide.<ref>Kershaw, Ian ''Hitler Nemesis'', New York: W.

As Kershaw noted, these divergent interpretations such as the differences between the functionalist view of the Holocaust as caused by a process and the intentionalist view of the Holocaust as caused by a plan are not easily reconciled, and that there was in his opinion the need for a guide to explain the complex historiography surrounding these issues.<ref name="autogenerated18"/>

Likewise, if one accepts the Marxist view of National Socialism as the culmination of capitalism, then the Nazi phenomenon is universal, and fascism can come to power in any society where capitalism is the dominant economic system, whereas the view of National Socialism as the culmination of ''Deutschtum'' means that the Nazi phenomenon is local and particular only to Germany. 

24. 

==Bavaria Project==
In 1975, Kershaw joined [[Martin Broszat]]'s "Bavaria Project". 

25. 
Kater contended that Kershaw downplayed the extent of popular antisemitism, and that though admitting that most of the "spontaneous" antisemitic actions of Nazi Germany were staged, argued that because these actions involved substantial numbers of Germans, it is wrong to see the extreme antisemitism of the Nazis as coming solely from above.<ref>Marrus, Michael. 

26. 
In regard to the debate between those who regard [[National Socialism]] as a type of [[totalitarianism]] (and thus having more in common with the [[Soviet Union]]) versus those who regard Nazism as a type of fascism (and thus having more in common with [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]]), Kershaw, though feeling that the totalitarianism approach is not without value, has argued that in essence, Nazism should be viewed as a type of fascism, albeit fascism of a very radical type.<ref>Kerhsaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold Press, 2000, pp.

For Kershaw, any historian writing about the period had to take account of the "historical-philosophical", "political-ideological" and moral problems associated with the period, which thus poses special challenges for the historian. 

32. 
141–142</ref> As Kershaw notes, the completely different ways Forster and Greiser sought to "Germanize" their ''Gaue'' with Forster simply having the local Polish population in his ''Gau'' signing forms saying they had "German blood" and Greiser carrying out a program of brutal [[ethnic cleansing]] of Poles in his ''Gau'' showed both how Hitler set events in motion, and how his ''Gauleiters'' could carry out totally different policies in pursuit of what they believed to be Hitler's wishes.<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref name="Rees, Laurence The Nazis pages 141-142"/> In Kershaw's opinion, Hitler's vision of a racially cleansed ''Volksgemeinschaft'' provided the impetus for German officials to carry out increasingly extreme measures to win his approval, which ended with the ''Shoah''.<ref>Kershaw, Ian "'Working Towards the Führer' Reflections on the Nature of the Hitler Dictatorship" pp. 

33. 
xx</ref> Kershaw has argued that it is absurd to seek to explain German history in the Nazi era solely through Hitler, as Germany had sixty-eight million people during the Nazi era, and to seek to explain the fate of sixty-eight million people solely through the prism of one man is in Kershaw's opinion a flawed position.<ref name="Lukacs, John 1997, page 32">Lukacs, John ''The Hitler of History'', New York: Vintage Books, 1997, 1998 p.

530–531</ref> {{anchor|Cumulative radicalization}}<!--Target for [[Cumulative radicalization of Nazi Germany]] -->Though Kershaw does not deny the radical antisemitism of the Nazis, he favours Mommsen's view of the Holocaust being caused by the "cumulative radicalization" of Nazi Germany caused by the endless bureaucratic power struggles and a turn towards increasingly radical antisemitism within the Nazi elite.

With regard to the [[Nazi Foreign Policy (debate)|Nazi foreign policy debate]] between "globalists" such as [[Klaus Hildebrand]], [[Andreas Hillgruber]], Jochen Thies, Gunter Moltman and [[Gerhard Weinberg]], who argue that Germany aimed at world conquest, and the "continentalists" such as [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], [[Eberhard Jäckel]] and Axel Kuhn, who argue that Germany aimed only at the conquest of Europe,<ref>Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems & Perspectives of Interpretation'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000 pp. 

36. 
137–139</ref>

Regarding the historical debates about [[German Resistance|''Widerstand'']] (resistance) in German society, Kershaw has argued that there are two approaches to the question, one of which he calls the ''fundamentalist'' (dealing with those committed to overthrowing the Nazi regime) and the ''societal'' (dealing with forms of dissent in "everyday life").<ref>Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold Press, 2000, p. 

37. 
Does the "Final Solution of the Jewish Question" thus become more easily understandable or the "twisted road to Auschwitz" become the one-way street of a psychopath in power?<ref name="autogenerated1"/></blockquote> Kershaw shares Wehler's opinion, that, besides the problem that such theories about Hitler's medical condition were extremely difficult to prove, they had the effect of personalising the phenomena of Nazi Germany by more or less attributing everything that happened in Nazi Germany to one flawed individual.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Kershaw's biography of Hitler is an examination of Hitler's power; how he obtained it and how he maintained it.<ref>Kershaw, Ian ''Hitler 1889–1936 Hubris'', W. 

38. 
19</ref> Kershaw noted the huge disparity of often incompatible views about the Nazi era such as the debate between:
* those who see the Nazi period as the culmination of ''Deutschtum'' (Germanism) and Marxists who see National Socialism as the culmination of capitalism
* those who argue for a ''[[Sonderweg]]'', and those who argue against the ''Sonderweg'' concept
* those who see National Socialism as a type of totalitarianism, and those who see it as a type of fascism
* those historians who favour a "functionalist" interpretation with the emphasis on the German bureaucracy and the Holocaust as an ''ad hoc'' process, and those who favour an "intentionalist" interpretation with the focus on Hitler and the argument that the Holocaust had been something planned from early on in Hitler's political career.<ref name="autogenerated18">Snowman, Daniel "Ian Kershaw", pp. 

39. 
215–217.</ref>

Regarding the debate in the late 1980s between [[Martin Broszat]] and [[Saul Friedländer]] over Broszat's call for the "historicization" of National Socialism, Kershaw wrote that he agreed with Friedländer that the Nazi period could not be treated as a "normal" period of history, but he felt that historians should approach the Nazi period as they would any other period of history.<ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 235">Kershaw, Ian, ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems & Perspectives of Interpretation'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 

40. 
531–533</ref> The only exceptions were the areas of [[foreign policy]] and military decisions, both areas that Hitler increasingly involved himself in from the late 1930s.<ref name="autogenerated4" />

In a 1993 essay "Working Towards the Führer", Kershaw argued that the German and Soviet dictatorships had more differences than similarities.<ref name="Kershaw pages 231-252"/> Kershaw argued that Hitler was a very unbureaucratic leader who was highly averse to paper work in marked contrast to [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]].<ref name="Kershaw pages 231-252"/> Likewise, Kershaw argued that Stalin was highly involved in the running of the Soviet Union in contrast to Hitler whose involvement in day-to-day decision making was limited, infrequent and capricious.<ref>Kershaw, Ian "'Working Towards the Führer' Reflections on the Nature of the Hitler Dictatorship" pp. 

41. 
xiii</ref> Kershaw's 1991 book ''Hitler: A Profile in Power'' marked a change for him from writing about how people viewed Hitler to writing about Hitler himself.<ref name="Snowman pages 18-20"/> In his two-volume biography of Hitler published in 1998 and 2000, Kershaw stated, "What I tried to do was to embed Hitler into the social and political context that I had already studied."<ref name="Snowman pages 18-20"/> Kershaw finds the picture of Hitler as a "mountebank" (opportunistic adventurer) in [[Alan Bullock]]'s biography unsatisfactory, and [[Joachim Fest]]'s quest to determine how "great" Hitler was senseless.<ref>Snowman, Daniel "Ian Kershaw" pp.

43. 
During his work, Broszat encouraged Kershaw to examine how ordinary people viewed Hitler.<ref name="reference" /> As a result of his work in the 1970s on Broszat's "Bavaria Project", Kershaw wrote his first book on [[Nazi Germany]], ''[[The "Hitler Myth": Image and Reality in the Third Reich]]'', which was first published in German in 1980 as ''Der Hitler-Mythos: Volksmeinung und Propaganda im Dritten Reich''.<ref name="reference" /> This book examined the "Hitler cult" in Germany, how it was developed by [[Joseph Goebbels]], what social groups the Hitler Myth appealed to and how it rose and fell.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Also arising from the "Bavaria Project" and Kershaw's work in the field of ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' was ''Popular Opinion and Political Dissent in the Third Reich''. 

44. 
Together we could have defeated [[Bolshevism]] and ruled the earth!"—adding in for good measure that "The Jew is a louse!"<ref name="reference"/> As a result of this incident, Kershaw became keen to learn how and why ordinary people in Germany could support the Nazi ideology (National Socialism or [[Nazism]]).<ref name="reference"/>

His wife, [[Betty Kershaw|Dame Betty Kershaw]], is a former professor of nursing and dean of the School of Nursing Studies at the [[University of Sheffield]]. 

45. 
154–159</ref> Kershaw agrees with the thesis that Hitler did formulate a programme for foreign policy centering on an alliance with Britain to achieve the destruction of the [[Soviet Union]], but has argued that a British lack of interest doomed the project, thus leading to the situation in 1939, where Hitler went to war with Britain, the country he wanted as an ally, not as an enemy, and the country he wanted as an enemy, the Soviet Union, as his ally.<ref>{{cite web|last=Roman|first=Thomas|title=Interview with Ian Kershaw|publisher=Eurozine|date=24 October 2002|url=http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2002-10-24-roman-en.html|accessdate=21 June 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222050848/http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2002-10-24-roman-en.html|archive-date=22 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> At the same time, Kershaw sees considerable merit in the work of such historians as [[Timothy Mason]], [[Hans Mommsen]], [[Martin Broszat]] and Wolfgang Schieder, who argue that Hitler had no "programme" in foreign policy, and instead contend that his foreign policy was simply a kneejerk reaction to domestic pressures in the economy and his need to maintain his popularity.<ref>Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems & Perspectives of Interpretation'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000, pp. 

46. 
246</ref> In this, Kershaw largely agrees with Mommsen's portrait of Hitler as a distant and remote leader standing in many ways above his own system, whose charisma and ideas served to set the general tone of politics.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

As an example of how Hitler's power functioned in practice, Kershaw used Hitler's directive to the ''Gauleiters'' [[Albert Forster]] and [[Arthur Greiser]] to "Germanize" the part of north-western Poland annexed to Germany in 1939 within the next 10 years with his promise that "no questions would be asked" about how this would be done.<ref name="ReferenceB">Kershaw, Ian "'Working Towards the Führer' Reflections on the Nature of the Hitler Dictatorship" pp.

But anyone who really works towards the Fuhrer along his lines and towards his goal will certainly both now and in the future, one day have the finest reward in the form of the sudden legal confirmation of his work.<ref>Werner Willikens quoted in Kershaw, Ian "'Working Towards the Führer.'Reflections on the Nature of the Hitler Dictatorship."—''Contemporary European History'' (1993): 103–118.</ref></blockquote>

Kershaw has argued that in Nazi Germany officials of both the German state and Party bureaucracy usually took the initiative in initiating policy to meet Hitler's perceived wishes, or alternatively attempted to turn into policy Hitler's often loosely and indistinctly phrased wishes.<ref name="autogenerated3" /> Though Kershaw does agree that Hitler possessed the powers that the "Master of the Third Reich" thesis championed by Norman Rich and [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]] would suggest, he has argued that Hitler was a "lazy dictator"; an indifferent dictator who was really not interested in involving himself much in the daily running of [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name="autogenerated4">Kershaw, Ian ''Hitler 1889–1936 Hubris'', W.

Despite his background in the functionalist historiography, Kershaw admits that his account of Hitler in World War II owes much to intentionalist historians like [[Gerhard Weinberg]], [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], [[Lucy Dawidowicz]] and [[Eberhard Jäckel]].<ref name="Snowman pages 18-20"/> Kershaw accepts the picture of Hitler drawn by intentionalist historians as a fanatical ideologue who was obsessed with [[social Darwinism]], [[Völkisch movement|''völkisch'']] [[antisemitism]] (in which the Jewish people were viewed as a "race" biologically different from the rest of humanity rather than a religion), militarism and the perceived need for ''[[Lebensraum]]''.<ref name="Snowman pages 18-20"/> However, in a 1992 essay, "Improvised genocide?", in which Kershaw traces how the ethnic cleansing campaign of ''Gauleiter'' [[Arthur Greiser]] in the [[Reichsgau Wartheland|Warthegau]]<ref>Apparently, Kershaw himself misspelled this as ''Morgenthau''.</ref> region annexed to Germany from Poland in 1939 led to a campaign of genocide by 1941, Kershaw argued that the process was indeed "improvised genocide" rather the fulfilment of a master plan.<ref>"'Improvised genocide?'

In ''The Nazi Dictatorship'', Kershaw surveyed the historical literature and offered his own assessment of the pros and cons of the various approaches.<ref name="Snowman pages 18-20"/>

In a 2008 interview, Kershaw lists as his major intellectual influences [[Martin Broszat]], [[Hans Mommsen]], Alan Milward, [[Timothy Mason]], [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[William Carr (historian)|William Carr]] and Jeremy Noakes.<ref name="Interview with Ian Kershaw">{{cite journal|title=Interview with Ian Kershaw|publisher=History|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/makinghistory/resources/interviews/Kershaw_Ian.html|date=14 May 2008|accessdate=9 June 2009}}</ref> In the same interview, Kershaw expressed strong approval of Mason's "Primacy of Politics" concept, in which it was German Big Business that served the Nazi regime rather than the other way around, against the orthodox Marxist "Primacy of Economics" concept.<ref name="Interview with Ian Kershaw"/> Despite his praise and admiration for Mason, in the 2000 edition of ''The Nazi Dictatorship'', Kershaw was highly skeptical of Mason's "Flight into War" theory of an economic crisis in 1939 forcing the Nazi regime into war.<ref>Kershaw, Ian, ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems & Perspectives of Interpretation'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000, pp.

7–8</ref> Along the same lines, Kershaw criticised as German apologetics the 1946 statement by the German historian [[Friedrich Meinecke]] that National Socialism was just a particularly unfortunate ''Betriebsunfall'' (industrial accident) of history.<ref name="Kershaw, Ian pages 7-8"/>

Kershaw was later in a 2003 essay to criticise both Ritter and Meinecke as German apologists who either through the ''Betriebsunfall'' theory and by blaming everything upon Hitler was seeking to white-wash the German past.<ref name="Kershaw 2004"/> Writing of the work of the German historian [[Rainer Zitelmann]], Kershaw has argued that Zitelmann has elevated what were merely secondary considerations in Hitler's remarks to the primary level, and that Zitelmann has not offered a clear definition of what he means by "modernization".<ref>Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold Press, 2000, pp.

Hitler) single-handedly caused the [[Second World War]] to be that of a German apologist, and that he found the historical approach of Ritter's arch-enemy [[Fritz Fischer]] to be a far better way of understanding German history.<ref name="Kershaw, Ian pages 7-8">Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold Press, 2000 pp. 

59. 
235</ref> In support of Broszat, Kershaw wrote that an ''Alltagsgeschichte'' approach to German history, provided that it did not lose sight of Nazi crimes, had much to offer as a way of understanding how those crimes occurred.<ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 235"/>

During the "Goldhagen Controversy" of 1996, Kershaw took the view that his friend, [[Hans Mommsen]], had "destroyed" [[Daniel Goldhagen]]'s arguments about a culture of "eliminationist antisemitism" in Germany during their frequent debates on German TV.<ref>Kershaw, Ian, ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems & Perspectives of Interpretation'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000 p.

In the ''[[Historikerstreit]]'' (Historians' Dispute) of 1986-89, Kershaw followed Broszat in criticising the work and views of [[Ernst Nolte]], [[Andreas Hillgruber]], [[Michael Stürmer]], [[Joachim Fest]] and [[Klaus Hildebrand]], all of whom Kershaw saw as German apologists attempting to white-wash the German past in various ways.

Kershaw has called Broszat an "inspirational mentor" who did much to shape his understanding of National Socialist Germany.<ref name="Kershaw 2004">{{cite web|last=Kershaw|first=Ian|title=Beware the Moral High Ground|publisher=H-Soz-u-Kult|date=February 2004|url=http://hsozkult.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/forum/type=diskussionen&id=418|accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref> Kershaw served as historical adviser on numerous [[BBC]] documentaries, notably ''[[The Nazis: A Warning from History]]'' and ''[[War of the Century]]''.
