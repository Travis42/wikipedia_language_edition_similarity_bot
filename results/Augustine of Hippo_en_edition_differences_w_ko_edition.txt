In ''On Rebuke and Grace'' (''De correptione et gratia''), Augustine wrote: "And what is written, that He wills all men to be saved, while yet all men are not saved, may be understood in many ways, some of which I have mentioned in other writings of mine; but here I will say one thing: He wills all men to be saved, is so said that all the predestinated may be understood by it, because every kind of men is among them."<ref name="St. 

7. 
He argued that the six-day structure of creation presented in the Book of Genesis represents a [[framework interpretation (Genesis)|logical framework]], rather than the passage of time in a physical way – it would bear a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, which is no less literal. 

8. 
Augustine believed that dialectic is the best means for learning and that this method should serve as a model for learning encounters between teachers and students. 

9. 

If a student has been well educated in a wide variety of subjects, the teacher must be careful not to repeat what they have already learned, but to challenge the student with material which they do not yet know thoroughly. 

10. 
With the student who has had no education, the teacher must be patient, willing to repeat things until the student understands, and sympathetic. 

11. 
Augustine stressed the importance of showing this type of student the difference between "having words and having understanding" and of helping the student to remain humble with his acquisition of knowledge.

Augustine's understanding of the consequences of original sin and the necessity of redeeming grace was developed in the struggle against [[Pelagius]] and his [[Pelagianism|Pelagian]] disciples, [[Caelestius]] and [[Julian of Eclanum]],<ref name="Gonzalez"/> who had been inspired by [[Rufinus of Syria]], a disciple of [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]].<ref>[[Marius Mercator]] ''Lib.

Nevertheless, the validity of the sacraments do not depend upon the holiness of the priests who perform them (''[[ex opere operato]]''); therefore, irregular sacraments are still accepted as valid provided they are done in the name of Christ and in the manner prescribed by the Church.

Although Augustine spent ten years as a Manichaean, he was never an initiate or "elect", but an "auditor", the lowest level in this religion's hierarchy.<ref name = "celife" /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Chadwick |first1=Henry |title=Augustine: A Very Short Introduction |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0191606632 |page=14}}</ref> While still at Carthage a disappointing meeting with the Manichaean Bishop, [[Faustus of Mileve]], a key exponent of Manichaean theology, started Augustine's scepticism of Manichaeanism.<ref name="celife" /> In Rome, he reportedly turned away from Manichaeanism, embracing the [[Philosophical scepticism|scepticism]] of the [[New Academy]] movement.

Although he later abandoned Some Neoplatonist Concepts, some ideas are still visible in his early writings.<ref>[[#Russel|Russell]], Book II, Chapter IV</ref> His early and influential writing on the [[Will (philosophy)|human will]], a central topic in [[ethics]], would become a focus for later philosophers such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]].

It sufficed for him to admit that they are metaphysically distinct: to be a human is to be a composite of soul and body, and the soul is superior to the body.

352–353.</ref> Catholic theologians generally subscribe to Augustine's belief that God exists [[eternity|outside of time]] in the "eternal present"; that time only exists within the created universe because only in space is time discernible through motion and change.

He was also influenced by the works of [[Virgil]] (known for his teaching on language), and [[Cicero]] (known for his teaching on argument).<ref name=encyclopedia/>

Because of his education, Augustine had great rhetorical prowess and was very knowledgeable of the philosophies behind many faiths.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Kishlansky| first1=Mark| last2=Geary| first2=Patrick| last3=O'Brien| first3=Patricia| title=Civilization in the West| date=2010| publisher=Pearson Education Inc.| location=New Jersey| pages=142–143| volume=Vol.

For it sees some things intrinsically excellent, in that more excellent nature which is God: and whereas it ought to remain steadfast that it may enjoy them, it is turned away from Him, by wishing to appropriate those things to itself, and not to be like to Him by His gift, but to be what He is by its own, and it begins to move and slip gradually down into less and less, which it thinks to be more and more."

He wrote that God "did not intend that this rational creature, who was made in his image, should have dominion over anything but the irrational creation – not man over man, but man over the beasts".

Already in his pre-Pelagian writings, Augustine taught that Original Sin is transmitted to his descendants by [[concupiscence]],<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Imperfectum Opus contra Iulianum'', II, 218</ref> which he regarded as the passion of both, soul and body,<ref group=lower-alpha>In 393 or 394 he commented: ''Moreover, if unbelief is fornication, and [[idolatry]] unbelief, and [[covetousness]] idolatry, it is not to be doubted that covetousness also is fornication.

====Predestination====
{{see also|Predestination}}
Augustine taught that God orders all things while preserving human freedom.<ref name="Levering">{{cite book |last=Levering |first=Matthew |title=Predestination: Biblical and Theological Paths |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-19-960452-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cLBS6Dl1OYgC}}</ref>{{rp|44}} Prior to 396, he believed that predestination was based on God's foreknowledge of whether individuals would believe in Christ, that God's grace was "a reward for human assent".<ref name="Levering"/>{{rp|48–49}} Later, in response to [[Pelagius]], Augustine said that the sin of [[pride]] consists in assuming that "we are the ones who choose God or that God chooses us (in his foreknowledge) because of something worthy in us", and argued that God's grace causes individual act of faith.<ref name="Levering"/>{{rp|47–48}}

Scholars are divided over whether Augustine's teaching implies [[double predestination]], or the belief that God chooses some people for damnation as well as some for salvation.

In ''On Christian Doctrine'' Augustine contrasts love, which is enjoyment on account of God, and lust, which is not on account of God.<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''On Christian Doctrine'', 3.37</ref> Augustine claims that, following the Fall, sexual passion has become necessary for copulation (as required to stimulate male erection), sexual passion is an evil result of the Fall, and therefore, evil must inevitably accompany sexual intercourse (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 1.19).

171.</ref> [[Hannah Arendt]] began her philosophical writing with a dissertation on Augustine's concept of love, ''Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin'' (1929): "The young Arendt attempted to show that the philosophical basis for ''vita socialis'' in Augustine can be understood as residing in neighbourly love, grounded in his understanding of the common origin of humanity."<ref>{{cite journal| author=Chiba, Shin| title= Hannah Arendt on Love and the Political: Love, Friendship, and Citizenship| journal=The Review of Politics| volume= 57| issue= 3 | year=1995| pages= 505–535 [507]| jstor=1408599| doi=10.1017/S0034670500019720}}</ref>

Jean Bethke Elshtain in ''Augustine and the Limits of Politics'' tried to associate Augustine with Arendt in their concept of evil: "Augustine did not see evil as glamorously demonic but rather as absence of good, something which paradoxically is really nothing.

====Creation====
{{See also|Allegorical interpretations of Genesis}}
In ''City of God'', Augustine rejected both the contemporary ideas of ages (such as those of certain Greeks and Egyptians) that differed from the Church's sacred writings.<ref>{{cite book |author=Augustine of Hippo |chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-02/npnf1-02-18.htm#P2017_1154484 |chapter=Of the Falseness of the History Which Allots Many Thousand Years to the World's Past |title=The City of God |at=Book&nbsp;12: Chapt.&nbsp;10 [419]}}</ref> In ''The Literal Interpretation of Genesis'' Augustine took the view that God had created everything in the universe simultaneously, and not over a period of six days as a literal interpretation of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] would require. 

135. 
|title=Genesi ad litteram liber imperfectus, De |encyclopedia=Augustine through the Ages: An Encyclopedia |year=1999}}</ref> As an additional support for describing the six days of creation as a [[heuristic]] device, Augustine thought that the actual event of creation would be incomprehensible by humans and therefore needed to be translated.<ref>{{cite book |last=Franklin-Brown |first=Mary |title=Reading the world: Encyclopedic writing in the scholastic age |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago & London |year=2012 |isbn=978-0226260709 |p=280}}</ref>

Augustine also does not envision original sin as causing structural changes in the universe, and even suggests that the bodies of [[Adam and Eve]] were already created mortal before [[Fall of man|the Fall]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Augustine of Hippo |title=On the Merits |at=1.2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Augustine of Hippo |title=City of God |at=13:1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Augustine of Hippo |title=Enchiridion |at=104}}</ref>

====Ecclesiology====
{{See also|Ecclesiology}}
[[File:Carlo Crivelli - St. 

136. 
The specific part to which Augustine opened his Bible was Romans chapter 13, verses 13 and 14, to wit:
{{Quote |Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof.<ref>{{cite book| author = Augustine of Hippo | title = Confessions |year= 2008| publisher= Oxford University Press| place = New York | pages =152–153 | others = Chadwick, Henry transl}}</ref>}}

He later wrote an account of his conversion – his very transformation, as Paul described – in his ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'' ({{lang-la|Confessiones}}), which has since become a classic of Christian theology and a key text in the history of [[autobiography]]. 

137. 
Catholic scholars tend to deny that he held such a view while some Protestants and secular scholars have held that Augustine did believe in double predestination.<ref>{{cite book |last=James |first=Frank A., III |year=1998 |title=Peter Martyr Vermigli and Predestination: The Augustinian Inheritance of an Italian Reformer |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford |url=https://www.questia.com/library/1833170/peter-martyr-vermigli-and-predestination-the-augustinian |url-access=subscription  |via=[[Questia]] |p=102}}</ref> About 412 AD, Augustine became the first Christian to understand predestination as a divine unilateral pre-determination of individuals' eternal destinies independently of human choice, although his prior Manichaean sect did teach this concept.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Widengren |first1=Geo |title=Der Manichäismus |date=1977 |publisher=Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft |location=Darmstadt |pages=63–65, 90}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stroumsa |first1=Gediliahu |title=Titus of Bostra and Alexander of Lycopolis: A Christian and a Platonic Refutation of Manichaean Dualism |journal=Neoplatonism and Gnosticism |date=1992 |volume=New York: University of New York Press. 

138. 
Augustine)|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2018-07-31}}</ref> Augustine believed that slavery did more harm to the slave owner than the enslaved person himself: "the lowly position does as much good to the servant as the proud position does harm to the master."<ref name=":0" /> Augustine proposes as a solution to sin a type of cognitive reimagining of one's situation, where slaves "may themselves make their slavery in some sort free, by serving not in crafty fear, but in faithful love," until the end of the world eradicated slavery for good: "until all unrighteousness pass away, and all principality and every human power be brought to nothing, and God be all in all."<ref name=":0" />

====Jews====
Against certain Christian movements, some of which rejected the use of [[Hebrew Scripture]], Augustine countered that God had chosen the [[Jews]] as a special people,<ref>[[Diarmaid MacCulloch]]. 

139. 
According to Possidius, one of the few miracles attributed to Augustine, the healing of an ill man, took place during the siege.<ref name=Weiskotten/>{{rp|43}} According to Possidius, Augustine spent his final days in prayer and repentance, requesting that the penitential [[Psalms|Psalms of David]] be hung on his walls so that he could read them. 

140. 
On this point Augustine departs from the earlier teaching of [[Cyprian]], who taught that converts from schismatic movements must be re-baptised.<ref name="Gonzalez"/> Augustine taught that sacraments administered outside the Catholic Church, though true sacraments, avail nothing.

====Original sin====
{{see also|Original sin}}

[[File:Saint Augustine by Philippe de Champaigne.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Philippe de Champaigne]], 17th century]]
Augustine taught that the sin of Adam and Eve was either an act of foolishness (''insipientia'') followed by pride and disobedience to God or that pride came first.<ref group=lower-alpha>He explained to Julian of Eclanum that it was a most subtle job to discern what came first: ''Sed si disputatione subtilissima et elimatissima opus est, ut sciamus utrum primos homines insipientia superbos, an insipientes superbia fecerit''.
