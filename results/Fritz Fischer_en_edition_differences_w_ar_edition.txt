[[Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg]] had made plans in September 1914 (after the war began) to annex all of Belgium, part of France and part of Russia.<ref name="Moses pages 386-387"/> Fischer suggested that there was continuity in German foreign policy from 1900 to the Second World War, implying that Germany was responsible for both world wars.

The book was preceded by Fischer's groundbreaking 1959  article in the ''[[Historische Zeitschrift]]'' in which he first published the arguments that he expanded upon in his 1961 book.

 In ''[[The Shield of Achilles: War, Peace, and the Course of History]]'', [[Philip Bobbitt]] has written that after Fischer published it became "impossible to maintain" that World War I had been a "ghastly mistake" rather than the consequence of German policy.<ref>''[[The Shield of Achilles: War, Peace, and the Course of History]]''.

These ideas were expanded in his later books ''Krieg der Illusionen'' ''(War of Illusions),'' ''Bündnis der Eliten'' ''(From Kaiserreich to Third Reich)'' and ''Hitler war kein Betriebsunfall'' ''(Hitler Was No Chance Accident).''<ref name="Moses pages 386-387"/> Though Fischer was an expert on the Imperial era, his work was important in the [[Nazi Foreign Policy (debate)|debate]] about the foreign policy of the [[Third Reich]].

For most Germans, it was acceptable to believe that Germany had caused [[World War II]], but not World War I, which was still widely regarded as a war forced upon Germany by its encircling enemies.

The American Klaus Epstein noted, when Fischer published his findings in 1961, that in his opinion Fischer instantly rendered obsolete every book previously published on the subject of responsibility for [[World War I|the First World War]], and German [[Septemberprogramm|aims in that war]].<ref>Epstein, Klaus.

The Australian historian John Moses noted in 1999 that the documentary evidence introduced by Fischer is extremely persuasive in arguing that Germany was responsible for World War I.<ref name="Moses pages 386-387"/> In 1990, ''[[The Economist]]'' advised its readers to examine Fischer’s “well documented” book to examine why people in Eastern Europe feared the prospect of German unification.<ref>"Keeping Up With The Crumbling East," ''The Economist'', Volume 314, Issue # 7641, February 10, 1990, p.

Fischer with his analytical model caused a revolution in German historiography.<ref name="Moses pages 328-329"/> Fischer's ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' heuristic, with its examination of the "inputs" into German foreign policy by domestic pressure groups and their interaction with the imperialist ideas of the German elite, forced a re-evaluation of German foreign policy in the Imperial era.<ref name="Moses pages 328-329"/> Fischer's discovery of Imperial German government documents advocating as a war aim the ethnic cleansing of Russian Poland and subsequent German colonization, to provide Germany with ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (living space) led many to argue that similar schemes pursued by the Nazis in World War II were not due solely to Adolf Hitler's ideas but rather reflected widely held German aspirations that long pre-dated Hitler.<ref name="Moses pages 328-329"/><ref>Epstein, Klaus Review.

170.</ref> Fischer's own position on German responsibility for World War I has become known as the "Fischer thesis."

In 1961, Fischer, who by then had risen to the rank of full professor at the [[University of Hamburg]], rocked the history profession with his first postwar book, ''Griff nach der Weltmacht: Die Kriegzielpolitik des kaiserlichen Deutschland 1914–1918'' (published in English as ''[[Germany's Aims in the First World War]]''), in which he argued that [[Germany]] had deliberately instigated World War I in an attempt to become a world power.<ref name="Moses pages 386-387"/> In this book, which was primarily concerned with the role played in the formation of German foreign policy by domestic pressure groups, Fischer argued that various pressure groups in German society had ambitions for aggressive imperialist policy in Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East.<ref name="Moses pages 386-387"/> In Fischer's opinion, the "[[Septemberprogramm|September Program]]" of September 1914 calling for the annexation of parts of Europe and Africa was an attempt at compromise between the demands of the lobbying groups in German society for wide-ranging territorial expansion.<ref name="Moses pages 386-387"/> Fischer argued that the German government used the crisis caused by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in the summer of 1914 to act on plans for a war against France and Russia, to create ''Mitteleuropa'', a German-dominated Europe, and ''Mittelafrika'', a German-dominated Africa.<ref name="Moses pages 328-329">Moses, John "The Fischer Controversy," ''Modern Germany An Encyclopedia of History, People and Culture, 1871-1990'', Volume 1, edited by Dieter Buse and Juergen Doerr, Garland Publishing: New York, 1998, p. 

19. 
For Fischer, German foreign policy before 1914 was largely motivated by the efforts of the reactionary German elite to distract the public from casting their votes for the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] and to make Germany the world's greatest power at the expense of France, Britain and Russia.<ref name="Moses pages 386-387"/> The German elite that caused World War I was also responsible for the failure of the [[Weimar Republic]], which opened the way for the Third Reich. 

20. 

In his 1969 book ''[[War of Illusions]]'' (Krieg der Illusionen), Fischer offered a detailed study of German politics from 1911 to 1914 in which he offered a ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' (Primacy of Domestic Politics) analysis of German foreign policy.<ref name="Moses pages 386-387"/> In Fischer's view, the Imperial German state saw itself under siege by rising demands for democracy at home and looked to distract democratic strivings through a policy of aggression abroad.<ref name="Moses pages 386-387"/>

Fischer was the first German historian to support the negative version of the [[Sonderweg]] ("special path") interpretation of German history,  which holds that the way German society developed from the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] (or from a later time, such as the establishment of the German Reich of 1871) inexorably culminated in the Third Reich.<ref name="Moses pages 386-387"/> In Fischer's view, while 19th-century German society moved forwards economically and industrially, it did not do so politically.

==Theorist and author==

===National Socialism===

After World War II, Fischer re-evaluated his previous beliefs, and decided that the popular explanations of [[National Socialism]] offered by such historians as [[Friedrich Meinecke]] in which [[Adolf Hitler]] was just a ''Betriebsunfall'' (an occupational accident, meaning 'a spanner in the works') of history were unacceptable.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In 1949, at the first post-war German Historians' Congress in [[Munich]], Fischer strongly criticized the Lutheran tradition in German life, accusing the Lutheran church of glorifying the state at the expense of individual liberties and thus helping to bring about [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Fischer complained that the Lutheran church had for too long glorified the state as a divinely sanctioned institution that could do no wrong, and thus paved the way for National Socialism.<ref>Moses, John "Fischer, Fritz," ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'' edited by Kelly Boyd, Volume 1, Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1999, pp.

==Biography==
Fischer was born in [[Ludwigsstadt]] in [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]].<ref name="Moses pages 386-387"/> His father was a railway inspector.<ref name="Moses pages 386-387"/> Educated at grammar schools in Ansbach and Eichstätt, Fischer attended the [[University of Berlin]] and the [[University of Erlangen]], where he studied history, pedagogy, philosophy and theology.<ref name="Moses pages 386-387"/> Fischer joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1939, and left the Party in 1942.<ref>{{cite news

This traditional German elite, in Fischer's analysis, was dominated by a racist, imperialist and capitalist ideology that was little different from the beliefs of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]].<ref name="Moses pages 386-387"/> For this reason, Fischer called Bethmann-Hollweg the "Hitler of 1914." Fischer's claims set off the so-called "Fischer Controversy" of the early 1960s when German historians led by [[Gerhard Ritter]] attempted to rebut Fischer.

In the 1950s, Fischer examined all of the Imperial German government archives in their entirety relating to The Great War.
