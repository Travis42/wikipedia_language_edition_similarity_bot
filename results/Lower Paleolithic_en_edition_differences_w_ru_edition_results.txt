Lower Paleolithic
en edition's differences with the ru version: 
-1.45519e-10
Many [[Mousterian]] finds in the [[Middle Paleolithic]] have been knapped using a Levallois technique, suggesting that [[Neanderthal Man|Neanderthals]] evolved from ''Homo erectus'' (or, perhaps, ''Homo heidelbergensis''; see below)
2.7012e-10
[[Derek Bickerton]] (2009) has designated to this period the  move from simple [[animal communication systems]] found in all [[great apes]] to the earliest form of symbolic communication systems capable of displacement (referring to items not currently within sensory perception) and motivated by the need to "recruit"  group members for scavenging large carcasses.<ref>Derek Bickerton, ''Adam's Tongue: How Humans Made Language, How Language Made Humans'', New York: Hill and Wang 2009.</ref>

''[[Homo erectus]]'' appeared by about 1.8 million years ago, via the transitional variety ''[[Homo ergaster]]''
6.40284e-10

Also, in Europe, a type of human appeared that was intermediate between ''Homo erectus'' and ''Homo sapiens'', sometimes summarized under [[Archaic humans|archaic ''Homo sapiens'']], typified by such fossils as those found at [[Swanscombe Man|Swanscombe]], [[Steinheim Skull|Steinheim]], [[Tautavel Man|Tautavel]], and [[Vertesszollos]] (''Homo palaeohungaricus'')

In Europe, the [[Olduwan]] tradition (known in Europe as [[Abbevillian]]) split into two parallel traditions, the [[Clactonian]], a flake tradition, and the [[Acheulean]], a [[hand-axe]] tradition

''[[Anatomically modern humans|Homo sapiens]]'' first appear about 300,000 years ago, as evidenced by fossils found at [[Jebel Irhoud]] in Morocco.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/world-s-oldest-homo-sapiens-fossils-found-morocco|title=World's oldest Homo sapiens fossils found in Morocco|date=2017-06-06|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en}}</ref>

The '''Lower Paleolithic''' (or '''Lower Palaeolithic''') is the earliest subdivision of the [[Paleolithic]] or Old [[Stone Age]]

Whether the earliest [[control of fire]] by hominins dates to the Lower or to the Middle Paleolithic remains an open question.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/lower-paleolithic |title=Lower Paleolithic |publisher=Dictionary com |date=  |author= |accessdate= December 30, 2016}}</ref>

==Gelasian==

The Lower Paleolithic began with the appearance of the first [[stone tool]]s in the world

Whether [[control of fire]] and earliest [[paleolithic burial|burials]] date to this period or only appear during the Middle Paleolithic is an open question

==Transition to the Middle Paleolithic==
{{further|Homo rhodesiensis|Anatomically modern humans}}
From about 300,000 years ago, technology, social structures and behaviour appear to grow more complex, with [[prepared-core technique]] lithics, earliest instances of [[paleolithic burial|burial]] and changes to [[hunting-gathering]] patterns of subsistence
0.176524
The most ancient European prehistoric sites, dated from 1.8 to 1.1 Ma, have been discovered in a variety of contexts: fl uvio- lacustrine (Dmanisi, Georgia; Orce, Spain), littoral (Monte Poggiolo, Italy)  |publisher=researchgate |date=  |author= |accessdate= December 28, 2016}}</ref>

==Middle Pleistocene==

{{see|Homo heidelbergensis||Archaic humans}}
The appearance of ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' about 600,000 years ago heralds a number of other new varieties, such as ''[[Homo rhodesiensis]]'' and ''[[Homo cepranensis]]'' about 400,000&nbsp;years ago
