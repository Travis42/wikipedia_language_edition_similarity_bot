How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

Amino acid dating

ja edition's differences with the en version: 


1. 
Most of the generated D body is discharged out of the body by physiological action. 

2. 
However, the D body incorporated in the teeth [[enamel] and [ivory] is not discharged out of the body, it accumulates with age. 

3. 
Therefore, by examining the ratio of the D body and The L body of the amino acid contained in the tooth, it is [remains]] it is necessary to know the estimated death age of [remains]] ref name . 

4. 
The ''amino acid dating method'' is a type of [physicochemical age] measurement method used for [archaeology] and [forensic science]. 

5. 
Half-life of carbon 14 is about 5730 years, since the half-life of the amino acid is longer than this, about 50,000 years was expected as an alternative to the radiocarbon dating method of the limit [ref name . 

6. 

The concentration of d body in the teeth, 1% if the death age 10 years old, is about 3% if 60 years old. 

7. 
In many cases, [direct optical division by chromatography]is used for analysis.</a0> ref name.kans>Kansai Medical University http://www3.kmu.ac.jp/legalmed/lect/pers.html [Forensic Lecture Personal Identification </ref>]. 

8. 
However, there is also a report that it is effective when there is no other suitable measurement method, such as when determining the age of about 100,000 to 1 million years of siliceous sediments on the seabed<ref> [Research on the age measurement of submarine sediments using the http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/jepsjmo/cd-rom/2000cd-rom/pdf/gb/gb-011.pdf amino acid racemicization reaction] </ref>. 

9. 
This method was conceived by an American physicist [Philip Abelson] and developed by [Jeffrey Bader].</a0>

For example, [Aspartic acid] is fast rate of racemicization <ref name .kans /> is half of the L body in 15,000 years if the temperature is 20 degrees C., ref name .ibu> [Relics tell] </ref> . 

10. 

Even at high temperatures of about 100 degrees C., racemicization by chemical reactions is hardly generated if about 6 hours, hardly occurs, it is difficult to become a factor of error<ref> [http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110002909858 the influence of acid hydrolysis in the age estimation method using the racemicization reaction of the vaginal amino acid] </ref> .
