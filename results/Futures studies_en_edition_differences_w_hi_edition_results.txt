This term has fallen from favor in recent decades because modern practitioners stress the importance of alternative and plural futures, rather than one monolithic future, and the limitations of prediction and probability, versus the creation of possible and preferable futures.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

By the early 2000s, educators began to independently institute futures studies (sometimes referred to as futures thinking) lessons in K-12 classroom environments.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Strong|first1=Kay|last2=Bishop|first2=Peter|title=Case Study: Futurizing the K-12 Teaching Practice|url=http://jfsdigital.org/articles-and-essays/2011-2/vol-15-no-4-june/symposium/case-study-futurizing-the-k-12-teaching-practice|website=Journal of Futures Studies|publisher=Tamkang University, Tamsui Campus|accessdate=23 February 2018|date=2011-06-05}}</ref> To meet the need, non-profit futures organizations designed curriculum plans to supply educators with materials on the topic

 Futures studies (colloquially called "'''futures'''" by many of the field's practitioners) seeks to understand what is likely to continue and what could plausibly change
3.72074e-09
Around the world the field is variously referred to as '''futures studies''', '''[[strategic foresight]]''', '''futuristics''', '''futures thinking''', '''futuring''', and '''futurology'''
3.72074e-09
First, futures studies often examines trends to compose possible, probable, and preferable futures along with the role "wild cards" can play on future scenarios
3.72074e-09
The primary effort in futures studies, then, is to identify and describe alternative futures in order to better understand the driving forces of the present or the structural dynamics of a particular subject or subjects
3.72074e-09

At present, the general futures studies model has been summarized as being concerned with "three Ps and a W", or possible, probable, and preferable futures, plus [[Wild card (Foresight research)|wildcards]], which are low probability but high impact events (positive or negative)
3.72074e-09

Designers have adopted futures methodologies including scenarios, trend forecasting, and futures research

===Imperial cycles and world order===

Imperial cycles represent an "expanding pulsation" of "mathematically describable" macro-historic trend.<ref>Hornell Hart, "The Logistic Growth of Political Areas," ''Social Forces'', 26, (1948): 396-7; [[Raoul Naroll]], "Imperial Cycles and World Order," ''Peace Research Society'', 7, (1967): 100-101.</ref> The [[List of largest empires]] contains imperial record progression in terms of territory or percentage of world population under single imperial rule

Its planning is meant to link and embed scenarios in “organizational processes such as strategy making, innovation, risk management, public affairs, and leadership development.”<ref>{{cite article|last1=Kupers|first1=Roland|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Angela|title=Living in the Futures|url=https://hbr.org/2013/05/living-in-the-futures|publisher=Harvard Business Review|edition=May 2013}}</ref>

Foresight studies can also consider the possibility of “wild card” events – or events that many consider would be impossible to envision – although often such events can be imagined as remote possibilities as part of foresight work
0.103695

Such improvements in the predictability of individual events do not though, from a [[Complex systems|complexity theory]] viewpoint, address the unpredictability inherent in dealing with entire systems, which emerge from the interaction between multiple individual events
0.108927
The aim of a professional futurist would be to identify conditions that could lead to these events in order to create “pragmatically feasible roads to alternative futures.”<ref>{{cite article|last1=Steinmuller|first1=Karlheinz|last2=Petersen|first2=John L.|title=Wild Card|publisher=The Millenium Project: Futures Research Methodology|edition=2009}}</ref>
