:Thus, in Bergsland & Vogt (1962), the authors make an impressive demonstration, on the basis of actual language data verifiable by extralinguistic sources, that the "rate of change" for [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] constituted around 4% per millennium, but for closely-connected [[Riksmal]] (Literary Norwegian), it would amount to as much as 20% (Swadesh's proposed "constant rate" was supposed to be around 14% per millennium)

===Starostin's method===
Another attempt to introduce such modifications was performed by the Russian linguist [[Sergei Starostin]], who had proposed the following:

* Systematic [[loanword]]s, borrowed from one language into another, are a disruptive factor and must be eliminated from the calculations; the one thing that really matters is the "native" replacement of items by items from the same language
0.107972

===Glottochronologic constant===
[[Robert Lees (linguist)|Robert Lees]] obtained a value for the "glottochronological constant" ('''r''') of words by considering the known changes in 13 pairs of languages using the 200 word list

==Methodology==
===Word list===
The original method presumed that the core vocabulary of a language is replaced at a constant (or constant average) rate across all languages and cultures and so can be used to measure the passage of time
0.203595
The failure to notice that factor was a major reason in Swadesh's original estimation of the replacement rate at under 14 words from the 100-wordlist per millennium, but the real rate is much slower (around 5 or 6)
0.203595
Introducing that correction effectively cancels out the "Bergsland & Vogt" argument since a thorough analysis of the Riksmal data shows that its basic wordlist includes about 15 to 16 borrowings from other Germanic languages (mostly [[Danish language|Danish]]), and the exclusion of those elements from the calculations brings the rate down to the expected rate of 5 to 6 "native" replacements per millennium

The idea was developed by [[Morris Swadesh]] under two assumptions: there indeed exists a relatively-stable ''basic vocabulary'' (referred to as ''[[Swadesh list]]s'') in all languages of the world; and, any replacements happen in a way analogous to [[radioactive decay]] in a constant percentage per time elapsed
0.205704
Lists were compiled by Morris Swadesh and assumed to be resistant against borrowing (originally designed in 1952 as a list of 200 items, but the refined 100-word list in Swadesh (1955)<ref name=swadesh1955>Swadesh, Morris
0.251935
The constant is related to the retention rate of words by the following formula:

:<math>L = 2\ln(r) </math>

''L'' is the rate of replacement, ln represents the [[natural logarithm]] and ''r'' is the glottochronological constant
