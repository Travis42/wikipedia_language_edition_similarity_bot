Until the late 19th century, [[literary criticism]] as an academic exercise dealt solely with [[poetry]] (including [[epic poem]]s like the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]],'' and poetic drama like [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]). 

2. 
It is the 'juridical' part of the sovereign function."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gottfried|first=Paul|date=1993-12-21|title=Alain de Benoist's Anti-Americanism|journal=Telos|language=en|volume=1993|issue=98–99|pages=127–133|doi=10.3817/0393099127|issn=1940-459X}}</ref></blockquote>This implies that gods of the first function are responsible for the overall structure and order of the universe, and those gods who possess juridical sovereignty are more closely connected to the realm of humans and are responsible for the concept of justice and order.

* [[Narrative film]] usually uses images and sounds on film (or, more recently, on analogue or digital [[video]] media) to convey a story. 

6. 
It explains some natural phenomenon whose causes are not obvious, or some ritual practice whose origin has been forgotten." Bacon views myths as narratives that serve a practical societal function of providing a satisfactory explanation for many of humanity's greatest questions. 

7. 
Here it has been found that the dense, contextual, and interpenetrating nature of social forces uncovered by detailed narratives is often more interesting and useful for both social theory and social policy than other forms of social inquiry. 

8. 
He and many other semioticians prefer the view that all texts, whether spoken or written, are the same, except that some authors [[encode (semiotics)|encode]] their texts with distinctive ''literary'' qualities that distinguish them from other forms of discourse. 

9. 
For Dumèzil, these functions were so vital, they manifested themselves in every aspect of life and were at the center of everyday life.<ref name=":2" />

These "functions", as Dumèzil puts it, were an array of [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] knowledge and wisdom that was reflected by the mythology.

Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian events within any given narrative</ref>

Narrative is found in all forms of human creativity, art, and entertainment, including [[public speaking|speech]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[music]] and [[song]], [[comics]], [[journalism]], [[film]], [[television]] and [[video]], [[video game]]s, [[radio program|radio]], [[game]]-play, [[play (activity)|unstructured recreation]] and [[performance]] in general, as well as some [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[drawing]], [[photography]] and other [[visual arts]], as long as a [[wikt:Sequence|sequence]] of events is presented. 

11. 

[[Oral storytelling]] is the earliest method for sharing narratives.<ref>International Journal of Education and the Arts | [https://web.archive.org/web/20080630042438/http://www.ijea.org/v2n1/ The Power of Storytelling: How Oral Narrative Influences Children's Relationships in Classrooms]</ref> During most people's childhoods, narratives are used to guide them on proper behavior, cultural history, formation of a communal identity and values, as especially studied in [[anthropology]] today among traditional [[indigenous people]]s.<ref>Hodge, ''et al.'' 2002. 

12. 
Agamemnon, Lycurgus, Coriolanus, King Arthur, Saladin, are real people whose fame and the legends which spread it have become world-wide." Legends are mythical figures whose accomplishments and accolades live beyond their own mortality and transcend to the realm of myth by way of verbal communication through the ages. 

13. 
 A narrative consists of a set of events (the story) recounted in a process of narration (or [[discourse]]), in which the events are selected and arranged in a particular order (the plot). 

14. 

Another theory regarding the purpose and function of mythological narratives derives from 20th Century [[Philology|philologist]] [[Georges Dumézil]] and his formative theory of the "'''trifunctionalism'''" found in [[Indo-European people|Indo-European]] mythologies.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Lindahl|first=Carl|last2=Dumezil|first2=Georges|last3=Haugen|first3=Einar|date=April 1980|title=Gods of the Ancient Northmen|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|language=en|volume=93|issue=368|pages=224|doi=10.2307/541032|issn=0021-8715|jstor=541032}}</ref> Dumèzil refers only to the myths found in Indo-European societies, but the primary assertion made by his theory is that Indo European life was structured around the notion of three distinct and necessary societal functions, and as a result, the various gods and goddesses in Indo European mythology assumed these functions as well. 

15. 
Bacon says, like myths, folktales are imagined and created by someone at some point, but differ in that folktales' primary purpose is to entertain; and that like legends, folktales may possess some element of truth in their original conception, but lack any form of credibility found in legends. 

16. 

But [[novel]]s, lending a number of voices to several characters in addition to narrator's, created a possibility of narrator's views differing significantly from the author's views. 

17. 
With the rise of the novel in the [[18th century in literature|18th century]], the concept of the narrator (as opposed to "author") made the question of narrator a prominent one for literary theory. 

18. 
Nevertheless, there is a clear trend to address literary narrative forms as separable from other forms. 

19. 
Narrators often incorporate minor changes in the story in order to tailor the story to different audiences.<ref>Piquemal, 2003.

"I'll fix your sword for you tomorrow, if you tell me a story while I'm doing it." The speaker was an Irish storyteller in 1935, framing one story in another (O'Sullivan 75, 264).

== Storytelling rights ==
Storytelling rights may be broadly defined as the ethics of sharing narratives (including—but not limited to—firsthand, secondhand and imagined stories). 

23. 
If the writer's intention is to get inside the world of a character, then it is a good choice, although a [[Third person limited|third-person limited narrator]] is an alternative that does not require the writer to reveal all that a first-person character would know. 

24. 
Journal of Transcultural Nursing, 6-11.</ref> Alaskan Indigenous Natives state that narratives teach children where they fit in, what their society expects of them, how to create a peaceful living environment, and to be responsible, worthy members of their communities.<ref name="Hodge" /> In the Mexican culture, many adult figures tell their children stories in order to teach children values such as individuality, obedience, honesty, trust, and compassion.<ref name="McDonald">MacDonald, M., McDowell, J., Dégh, L., & [[Toelken, B.]] (1999). 

25. 
Anthropology & Education Quarterly, 38: 278–296.</ref> Lastly, elders from [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan Native]] communities claim that the use of animals as metaphors allow children to form their own perspectives while at the same time self-reflecting on their own lives.<ref name="Iseke"/>

[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] elders also state that storytelling invites the listeners, especially children, to draw their own conclusions and perspectives while self-reflecting upon their lives.<ref name="Hodge" /> Furthermore, they insist that narratives help children grasp and obtain a wide range of perspectives that help them interpret their lives in the context of the story. 

26. 
By contrast, a [[Third-person omniscient narrative|third-person omniscient narrator]] gives a panoramic view of the world of the story, looking into many characters and into the broader background of a story.

The moment recalls the Thousand and One Nights , where the story of "The Envier and the Envied" is enclosed in the larger story told by the Second Kalandar (Burton 1 : 113-39), and many stories are enclosed in others."<ref name=":0" /></blockquote>

==Aesthetics approach==
Narrative is a highly aesthetic art. 

28. 
Myths are believed to occur in a remote past—one that is before the creation or establishment of the civilization they derive from, and are intended to provide an account for things such as our origins, natural phenomenon, as well as our own human nature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bascom|first=William|date=January 1965|title=The Forms of Folklore: Prose Narratives|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|language=en|volume=78|issue=307|pages=3–20|doi=10.2307/538099|issn=0021-8715|jstor=538099}}</ref> Thematically, myths seek to provide information about ourselves, and many are viewed as among some of the oldest forms of prose narratives, which grants traditional myths their fascinating and life defining characteristics that continue to be communicated today.

The action skeleton can then be abstracted, comprising a further digraph where the actions are depicted as nodes and edges take the form "action '''a''' co-determined (in context of other actions) action '''b'''".

Generally, a [[First-person narrative|first-person narrator]] brings greater focus on the feelings, opinions, and perceptions of a particular character in a story, and on how the character views the world and the views of other characters. 

32. 
{{Short description|Account that presents connected events}}
{{For|other uses of "story"|Story (disambiguation)}}

A '''narrative''' or '''story''' is an account of a series of related events, experiences, or the like, whether true (episode, vignette, travelogue, memoir, autobiography, biography) or fictitious (fairy tale, fable, story, epic, legend, novel).<ref>{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Harmon|2012}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Random House|1979}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Webster|1984}}</ref> The word derives from the Latin verb ''narrare'' (to tell), which is derived from the adjective ''gnarus'' (knowing or skilled).<ref>{{harvtxt|Traupman|1966}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}</ref> Along with [[argumentation]], [[description]], and [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], narration, broadly defined, is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse. 

33. 
However, a third-person narrator does not need to be an omnipresent guide, but instead may merely be the protagonist referring to himself in the third person (also known as third person limited narrator). 

34. 
Several art movements, such as [[modern art]], refuse the narrative in favor of the [[abstract art|abstract]] and [[conceptual art|conceptual]]. 

35. 
 Narratives are to be distinguished from descriptions of qualities, states, or situations, and also from dramatic enactments of events (although a dramatic work may also include narrative speeches).

The linguistic correlates of each Big Five trait are as follows:
* [[Extraversion]] - positively correlated with words referring to humans, social processes and family;
* [[Agreeableness]] - positively correlated with family, inclusiveness and certainty; negatively correlated with anger and body (that is, few negative comments about health/body);
* [[Conscientiousness]] - positively correlated with achievement and work; negatively related to body, death, anger and exclusiveness;
* [[Neuroticism]] - positively correlated with sadness, negative emotion, body, anger, home and anxiety; negatively correlated with work;
* [[Openness]] - positively correlated with perceptual processes, hearing and exclusiveness

==Social sciences approaches==
Human beings often claim to understand events when they manage to formulate a coherent story or narrative explaining how they believe the event was generated.

He reported that, "More and more of the '[[new historian]]s' are now trying to discover what was going on inside people's heads in the past, and what it was like to live in the past, questions which inevitably lead back to the use of narrative."<ref>Lawrence Stone, "The Revival of Narrative: Reflections on a New Old History," ''Past and Present'' 85 (1979), pp.

In ''Storytelling Rights: The uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents'', author Amy Shuman offers the following definition of storytelling rights: “the important and precarious relationship between narrative and event and, specifically, between the participants in an event and the reporters who claim the right to talk about what happened."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Storytelling rights : the uses of oral and written texts by urban adolescents|last=1951-|first=Shuman, Amy|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521328463|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]|oclc=13643520|url=https://archive.org/details/storytellingrigh00shum}}</ref>

The ethics of retelling other people's stories may be explored through a number of [[question]]s: whose [[Story arc|story]] is being told and how, what is the story's purpose or aim, what does the story promise (for instance: empathy, redemption, authenticity, clarification)--and at whose benefit. 

41. 
Stories are often used within [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|indigenous cultures]] in order to share knowledge to the younger generation.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://cojmc.unl.edu/nativedaughters/storytellers/native-storytellers-connect-the-past-and-the-future | title=Native storytellers connect the past and the future : Native Daughters}}</ref> Due to indigenous narratives leaving room for open-ended interpretation, native stories often engage children in the storytelling process so that they can make their own meaning and explanations within the story. 

42. 
Frazer contends that there are three primary categories of mythology (now more broadly considered categories of folklore): [[Myth]]s, [[legend]]s, and folktales, and that by definition, each genre pulls its narrative from a different ontological source, and therefore have different implications within a civilization.

Haring provides an example from the Arabic folktales of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|A Thousand and One Nights]]'' to illustrate how framing was used to loosely connect each story to the next, where each story was enclosed within the larger narrative.

Considering how mythologies have historically been transmitted and passed down through oral retellings, there is no qualitative or reliable method to precisely trace exactly where and when a tale originated; and since myths are rooted in a remote past, and are viewed as a factual account of happenings within the culture it originated from, the worldview present in many oral mythologies is from a [[Cosmology|cosmological]] perspective—one that is told from a [[Voice (grammar)|voice]] that has no physical embodiment, and is passed down and modified from generation to generation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lyle|first=Emily|date=2006|title=Narrative Form and the Structure of Myth|journal=Folklore: Electronic Journal of Folklore|volume=33|pages=59–70|doi=10.7592/fejf2006.33.lyle|issn=1406-0957}}</ref> This cosmological worldview in myth is what provides all mythological narratives credence, and since they are easily communicated and modified through oral tradition amongst various cultures, they help solidify the [[cultural identity]] of a civilization and contribute to the notion of a [[Collective consciousness|collective human consciousness]] that continues to help shape our own understanding of the world.<ref>{{Citation|chapter=Fables, Myths and Stories|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=9781472598387|doi=10.5040/9781472598387.ch-006|title=Plato: A Guide for the Perplexed|year=2007}}</ref>

[[Myth]] is often used in an overarching sense to describe a multitude of [[Folklore|folklore genres]], but there is a significance in distinguishing the various forms of folklore in order to properly determine what narratives constitute as mythological, as esteemed anthropologist [[James George Frazer|Sir James Frazer]] suggests.

Dumèzil viewed his theory of trifunctionalism as distinct from other mythological theories because of the way the narratives of Indo-European mythology permeated into every aspect of life within these societies, to the point that the societal view of death shifted away from our primal perception that tells us to fear death, and instead death became seen as the penultimate act of heroism—by solidifying your position in the hall of the gods when you pass from this realm to the next. 

49. 
Such an identity upholds native epistemology and gives children a sense of belonging as their cultural identity develops through the sharing and passing on of stories.<ref>Piquemal, N.

Moreover, community members also let the children interpret and build a different perspective of each story.<ref name="Hodge" />

==Historiography==
In [[historiography]], according to [[Lawrence Stone]], narrative has traditionally been the main [[rhetorical device]] used by historians. 

51. 
This is first seen in [[Russian Formalism]] through [[Victor Shklovsky]]'s analysis of the relationship between composition and style, and in the work of [[Vladimir Propp]], who analysed the [[plot (narrative)|plots]] used in traditional folk-tales and identified 31 distinct functional components.<ref>Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p 25, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}</ref> This trend (or these trends) continued in the work of the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague School]] and of French scholars such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Roland Barthes]].

Narratives so conceived comprise the following ingredients:
* A finite set of state descriptions of the world S, the components of which are weakly ordered in time;
* A finite set of actors/agents (individual or collective), P;
* A finite set of actions A;
* A mapping of P onto A;

The structure ([[directed graph]]) is generated by letting the nodes stand for the states and the directed edges represent how the states are changed by specified actions.

These myths functioned to convey the themes of heroism, strength, and bravery and were most often represented in both the human world and the mythological world by valiant warriors.

;Bayesian narratives
Developed by [[Peter Abell]], the theory of Bayesian Narratives conceives a narrative as a [[directed graph]] comprising multiple causal links (social interactions) of the general form: "action '''''a''''' causes action '''''b''''' in a specified context".

Unlike most forms of narratives that are inherently language based (whether that be narratives presented in literature or orally), film narratives face additional challenges in creating a cohesive narrative. 

59. 
Narratives may also be nested within other narratives, such as narratives told by an [[unreliable narrator]] (a [[character (arts)|character]]) typically found in the genre of [[noir fiction]].

Such elements include the idea of [[narrative structure]], with identifiable beginnings, middles and ends, or exposition-development-climax-denouement, with coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality including retention of the past, attention to present action and protention/future anticipation; a substantial focus on character and characterization, "arguably the most important single component of the novel" ([[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] ''The Art of Fiction'' 67); different voices interacting, "the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms and registers" (Lodge ''The Art of Fiction'' 97; see also the theory of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] for expansion of this idea); a narrator or narrator-like voice, which "addresses" and "interacts with" reading audiences (see [[Reader Response]] theory); communicates with a [[Wayne Booth]]-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, forming a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, "arguing" for and against various positions; relies substantially on the use of literary tropes (see [[Hayden White]], ''Metahistory'' for expansion of this idea); is often intertextual with other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward ''[[bildungsroman]]'', a description of identity development with an effort to evince ''becoming'' in character and community.

This is in line with Fludernik's perspective on what's called cognitive narratology—which states that a literary text has the ability to manifest itself into an imagined, representational illusion that the reader will create for themselves, and can vary greatly from reader to reader.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fludernik|first=Monika|date=2001-08-01|title=Narrative Voices--Ephemera or Bodied Beings|journal=New Literary History|language=en|volume=32|issue=3|pages=707–710|doi=10.1353/nlh.2001.0034|issn=1080-661X}}</ref> In other words, the scenarios of a literary text (referring to settings, frames, schemes, etc.) are going to be represented differently for each individual reader based on a multiplicity of factors, including the reader's own personal life experiences that allow them to comprehend the literary text in a distinct manner from anyone else.
