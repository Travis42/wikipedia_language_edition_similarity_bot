All key dates in human history can then be listed using a simple increasing date scale with smaller dates always occurring before larger dates

These issues include: 
* The ''[[Anno Domini]]'' era is based on the [[Chronology of Jesus#Year of birth estimates|erroneous estimation of the birth year]] of Jesus
0.0488824
* The ''Anno Domini'' era has no [[0 (year)|year zero]], with 1 BC followed immediately by AD 1, complicating the calculation of timespans further

A consensus view was formally adopted by the [[International Union of Geological Sciences|IUGS]] in 2013, placing its start at 11,700 years before 2000 (9701 BC), about 300 years more recent than the epoch of the Holocene calendar.<ref name="jqs">{{cite journal| last1 = Walker| first1 = Mike| last2 = Jonsen| first2 = Sigfus| last3 = Rasmussen| first3 = Sune Olander| last4 = Popp| first4 = Trevor| last5 = Steffensen| first5 = Jørgen-Peder| last6 = Gibbard| first6 = Phil| last7 = Hoek| first7 = Wim| last8 = Lowe| first8 = John| last9 = Andrews| first9 = John| last10 = Björck| first10 = Svante| last11 = Cwynar| first11 = Les C.| last12 = Hughen| first12 = Konrad| last13 = Kershaw| first13 = Peter| last14 = Kromer| first14 = Bernd| last15 = Litt| first15 = Thomas| last16 = Lowe| first16 = David J.| last17 = Nakagawa| first17 = Takeshi| last18 = Newnham| first18 = Rewi| last19 = Schwander| first19 = Jacob|author-link10=Svante Björck|year=2009 |title=Formal definition and dating of the GSSP (Global Stratotype Section and Point) for the base of the Holocene using the Greenland NGRIP ice core, and selected auxiliary records |url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/GSSP/Holocene.pdf |format=PDF |journal = Journal of Quaternary Science|volume=24 |issue= 1|pages=3–17 |doi=10.1002/jqs.1227 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104131948/http://www.stratigraphy.org/GSSP/Holocene.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-04| bibcode = 2009JQS....24....3W}}</ref> {{Synthesis inline span|This would mean all Holocene calendar dates would have to be pushed back by 300 years (for example, AD 1 would become 9701 HE instead of 10001 HE).|date=December 2019}}

==Conversion==
Conversion from [[Julian calendar|Julian]] or [[Gregorian calendar]] years to the Human Era can be achieved by adding 10,000 to the AD/CE year

The present year, {{currentyear}}, can be transformed into a Holocene year by adding the digit "1" before it, making it {{formatnum:1{{currentyear}}}} HE

The HE scheme was first proposed by [[Cesare Emiliani]] in 1993 (11993 HE).<ref name=emiliani />

==Overview==
Cesare Emiliani's proposal for a [[calendar reform]] sought to solve a number of alleged problems with the current ''Anno Domini'' era, which number the years of the commonly accepted world calendar
0.293803

===Accuracy===
When Emiliani discussed the calendar in a follow-up article in 1994, he mentioned that there was no agreement on the date of the start of the Holocene epoch, with estimates at the time ranging between 12,700 and 10,970 years [[Before Present|BP]].<ref name=emiliani94 /> Since then, scientists have improved their understanding of the Holocene on the evidence of [[ice core]]s and can now more accurately date its beginning
