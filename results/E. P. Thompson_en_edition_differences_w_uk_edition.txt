Thompson authored ''Time, Work-Discipline, and Industrial Capitalism'', published in 1967, which posits that reliance on clock-time is a result of the European [[Industrial Revolution]] and that neither industrial capitalism nor the creation of the modern state would have been possible without the imposition of synchronic forms of time and work discipline.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=E.

=== Time discipline ===
Time discipline, as it pertains to [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]], is the general name given to [[Society|social]] and economic rules, conventions, customs, and expectations governing the measurement of time, the [[social currency]] and awareness of time measurements, and people's expectations concerning the observance of these customs by others. 

6. 
 As Thompson noted in his preface to the second edition (1976), the first edition (1955) appears to have received relatively little attention from the literary establishment because of its then-unfashionable Marxist point of view. 

7. 
He was a vociferous left-wing socialist critic of the Labour governments of 1964–70 and 1974–79, and an early and constant supporter of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], becoming during the 1980s the leading intellectual light of the movement against nuclear weapons in Europe.<ref name="GriffinUnconventional">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/06/ep-thompson-unconventional-historian|title=EP Thompson: the unconventional historian|last=Griffin|first=Emma|date=6 March 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=16 May 2016|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

 Although he left the party in 1956 over the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Soviet invasion]] of Hungary, he nevertheless remained a "historian in the [[Karl Marx|Marxist]] tradition", calling for a rebellion against [[Stalinism]] as a prerequisite for the restoration of communists' "confidence in our own revolutionary perspectives".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110615024039/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-2476038/Reasoning-rebellion-E-P-Thompson.html "Reasoning rebellion: E. 

9. 
However, it is likely that earlier views of time were imposed by religious and other social authorities prior to the industrial revolution, Thompson's work identified [[time discipline]] as an important concept for study within the [[social science]]s.

===Freelance polemicist===
Thompson left the [[University of Warwick]] in protest at the commercialisation of the academy, documented in the book ''Warwick University Limited'' (1971). 

11. 
Writing for the [[Times Higher Education]] in 2013, [[Robert Colls]] recalled the power of Thompson's book for his generation of young British leftists:

<blockquote>I bought my first copy in 1968 – a small, fat bundle of [[Pelican Books|Pelican]] with a picture of a Yorkshire miner on the front – and I still have it, bandaged up and exhausted by the years of labour.

Thompson's thought was also original and significant because of the way he defined "class."  To Thompson, class was not a structure, but a relationship:

{{quote|text=And class happens when some men, as a result of common experiences (inherited or shared), feel and articulate the identity of their interests as between themselves, and as against other men whose interests are different from (and usually opposed to) theirs.

After [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|"secret speech"]] to the 20th Congress of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1956, which revealed that the Soviet party leadership had long been aware of Stalin's crimes, Thompson (with [[John Saville]] and others) started a dissident publication inside the CP, called ''The Reasoner''.

==Career==

===''William Morris''===
Thompson's first major work of scholarship was his biography of [[William Morris]], written while he was a member of the Communist Party. 

41. 
Subtitled  ''From Romantic to Revolutionary'', it was part of an effort by the Communist Party Historians' Group, inspired by Torr, to emphasise the domestic roots of Marxism in Britain at a time when the Communist Party was under attack for always following the Moscow line. 

42. 
From 1981 onward, Thompson was a frequent contributor to the American magazine ''[[The Nation]]''.<ref name="thenation">{{cite book |title=The Nation: 1865-1990 |editor-last=vanden Heuvel |editor-first=Katrina |editor-link=Katrina vanden Heuvel |publisher=[[Thunder's Mouth Press]] |location=New York |date=1990 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781560250012/page/325 325] |isbn=978-1560250012 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781560250012/page/325 }}</ref>

===Voice of the peace movement===
From 1980, Thompson was the most prominent intellectual of the revived movement for [[nuclear disarmament]], revered by activists throughout the world. 

43. 
He is probably best known today for his historical work on the British radical movements in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, in particular ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' (1963).<ref name="CollsStillRelevant">{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/still-relevant-the-making-of-the-english-working-class/2009137.article|title=Still relevant: The Making of the English Working Class|last=Colls|first=Robert|authorlink = Robert Colls|date=21 November 2013|work=[[Times Higher Education]]|accessdate=16 May 2016}}</ref>

Thompson published biographies of [[William Morris]] (1955) and (posthumously) [[William Blake]] (1993) and was a prolific journalist and essayist. 

44. 
Thompson was born in [[Oxford]] to [[Methodist]] missionary parents: His father, [[Edward John Thompson]] (1886–1946) was a poet and admirer of the Nobel Prize–winning poet [[Tagore]].

'''Edward Palmer Thompson''' (3 February 1924 – 28 August 1993) was a British historian, writer, socialist and peace campaigner.
