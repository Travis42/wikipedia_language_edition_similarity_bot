Historical materialism is [[materialist]] as it does not believe that [[history]] has been driven by individual's [[consciousness]] or [[platonic ideal|ideals]], but rather ascribes to the philosophical [[monism]] that [[matter]] is the fundamental substance of [[nature]] and henceforth the driving force in all of [[world history]]; this drove Marx and other historical materialists to abandon ideas such as [[rights]] (e.g

Marx made the following comments on the higher-phase of communist society:

<blockquote>In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the [[division of labor]], and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly—only then can the narrow horizon of [[Idealism|bourgeois right]] be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!]]<ref name="marxists.org"/></blockquote>

Marx also describes a communist society developed alongside the proletarian dictatorship:
<blockquote>Within the co-operative society based on common ownership of the means of production, the producers do not exchange their products; just as little does the labor employed on the products appear here as the value of these products, as a material quality possessed by them, since now, in contrast to capitalist society, individual labor no longer exists in an indirect fashion but directly as a component part of total labor

What we have to deal with here is a communist society, not as it has ''developed'' on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it ''emerges'' from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges
