 There is a legend that the Prophet Muhammad's coffin was suspended without visible supports, from the ceiling of his tomb, just as a wild deed just hangs there, not touching the chain of title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/mahomet.html|title=Mahomet|accessdate=21 August 2015|website=Infoplease.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908020352/http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/mahomet.html|archivedate=8 September 2015}}</ref>

{{Property law}}

A '''deed''' (anciently "an '''evidence'''") is any [[legal instrument]] in writing which passes, affirms or confirms an [[interest]], [[right]], or [[property]] and that is signed, attested, delivered, and in some [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdictions]], [[seal (emblem)|sealed]]. 

3. 
A wild deed does not provide constructive notice to later purchasers of the property, because subsequent bona fide purchasers cannot reasonably be expected to locate the deed while investigating the chain of title to the property. 

4. 

===Bargain and sale deed===
{{main|Bargain and sale deed}}

A third type of deed, known as a ''bargain and sale deed'', implies that the grantor has the right to convey title but makes no warranties against encumbrances. 

5. 

===Wild deeds===
A deed that is recorded, but is not connected to the chain of title of the property, is called a '''wild deed'''. 

6. 

=== Quitclaim deed ===
{{main|Quitclaim deed}}

A so-called ''[[quitclaim deed]]'' is (in most jurisdictions) actually not a deed at all—it is actually an [[estoppel]] disclaiming rights of the person signing it to property. 

7. 

==Deeds of conveyance==

===General and special warranty===
{{main|Warranty deed}}
[[File:Providence, Rhode Island, Original Deed.jpg|thumb|right|The original 1636 [[Aboriginal title in the United States|Indian deed]] creating the Colony of [[Rhode Island]] signed by Native American Chief [[Canonicus]] to [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]]]

In the transfer of real estate, a deed conveys ownership from the old owner (the grantor) to the new owner (the grantee), and can include various [[Warranty|warranties]]. 

8. 

===Deed of trust===
In some jurisdictions, a [[trust deed (real estate)|deed of trust]] is used as an alternative to a [[Mortgage law|mortgage]]. 

9. 
Agreements under seal are also called [[contract]]s by deed or ''specialty''; in the United States, a specialty is enforceable without [[consideration]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/contract-under-seal/|title=Contract under Seal Law & Legal Definition|website=USLegal.com|accessdate=21 August 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503225201/http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/contract-under-seal|archivedate=3 May 2015}}</ref> In some jurisdictions, specialties have a [[Legal liability|liability]] limitation period of double that of a [[simple contract]] and allow for a [[third party beneficiary]] to enforce an undertaking in the deed, thereby overcoming the doctrine of [[privity of contract|privity]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Andrew |last=Griffiths|title=Contracting With Companies|location= London |publisher=[[Hart Publishing]] |year=2005| page=7}}</ref> Specialties, as a form of contract, are [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]] and can therefore be distinguished from [[Covenant (law)|covenants]], which, being also under seal, are unilateral promises. 

10. 
joint tenants in common===
When deeds are taken as joint tenants with rights of survivorship (JTWROS) or joint tenants in common (TIC), any co-owner can file a petition for partition to dissolve the tenancy relationship. 

11. 
The grantor may give a general warranty of title against any claims, or the warranty may be limited to only claims which occurred after the grantor obtained the real estate. 

12. 
* The [[grantor]] must have the legal ability to grant the thing or privilege, and the [[grantee]] must have the legal capacity to receive it. 

13. 
** Conditions
** Warranty – grantor warrants the title to the grantee
*** general: when the warrant is against all persons
*** special: when it is only against the grantor, his heirs and those claiming under him
** Covenants – binding limitations or promises
* Conclusion (or [[eschatocol]]) – execution and date
** Testimonium (Scotland: ''testing clause'') – attests to the due execution of a deed or instrument. 

14. 
First introduced in [[South Australia]] in 1858 by Sir [[Robert Richard Torrens|Robert Torrens]] and adopted later by the other Australian states and other countries, ownership under Torrens title is proven by possession of a certificate of title and the corresponding entry in the property register. 

15. 
Some Australian properties are still conveyed using a chain of title deeds – usually properties that have been owned by the same family since the nineteenth century – and these are often referred to as 'Old System' deeds. 

16. 
Deeds include [[conveyancing|conveyances]], [[Contract|commissions]], [[license]]s, [[patent]]s, [[diploma]]s, and conditionally [[power of attorney|powers of attorney]] if executed as deeds. 

17. 
 In most parts of the United States, deeds must be submitted to the [[recorder of deeds]], who acts as a cadastre, to be registered. 

18. 
While a ''general warranty deed'' was normally used for residential real estate sales and transfers, special warranty deeds are becoming more common and are more commonly used in commercial transactions. 

19. 
An unrecorded deed may be valid proof of ownership between the parties, but may have no effect upon third-party claims until disclosed or recorded. 

20. 
Examples of an agreement are agreement to sale, loan agreement etc. 

21. 

===Joint ownership===
Ownership transfer may also be crafted within deeds to pass by demise, as where a property is held in [[concurrent estate]] such as "joint tenants with right of survivorship" (JTWROS) or "tenants by the entirety". 

22. 
It is commonly used in some states — California, for example — to transfer title to land to a “trustee”, usually a trust or title company, which holds the title as security ("in [[escrow]]") for a loan. 

23. 
Credits may be allowed for utilities and maintenance; however, credits for improvements may not be allowed unless the improvements actually added substantial value to the property. 

24. 

In most states joint tenancy with the right of survivorship requires all owners to have equal interests in the property, meaning upon sale or partition of the property, all owners would receive an equal distribution of the proceeds. 

25. 

===Pardon as deed===
In the [[United States]], a [[pardon]] of the [[President of the United States|President]] was once considered to be a deed and thus needed to be accepted by the recipient. 

26. 

== Requirements ==
At [[common law]], to be valid and enforceable, a deed must meet several requirements:
* It must state on its face that it is a deed, using wording like "This Deed..." or "executed as a deed".

** Tenendum – "to have and to hold", formerly referring to the tenure by which the estate granted was to be held, though now completely symbolic
** Reddendum – reserves something to grantor out of thing granted, such as rent, under the formula "yielding and paying". 

28. 

==Structure==
The main clauses of a deed of conveyance are:
* Premises
** Parties clause – sets out the names, addresses, and descriptions (vendor/purchaser, grantor/grantee, transferor/transferee) of parties
** Recitals – narrates in chronological order the previous ownership of the property being conveyed, starting with the earliest deed of title down to the contract of sale the conveyance gives effect to
** Testatum – a command to witness which acknowledges the payment and receipt of the consideration and signals the beginning of the operative part; usually begins with "Now this Deed witnesseth"
* Operative part
** Operative clause – vendor gives effect to the contract of sale by conveying his interest in land to the purchaser
** Parcels clause – clause detailing the location and description of the property being conveyed
** Habendum – clause indicating the estate (freehold, etc.) or interest to be taken by the grantee<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|editor1-last=Rapalje|editor1-first=Stewart|editor2-last=Lawrence|editor2-first=Robert L.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OwAVAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|encyclopedia=A Dictionary of American and English Law|title=Habendum|location=Jersey City, N.J.|publisher=F.D. 

29. 
During either partition, credits may be awarded to any co-owner who may have contributed in excess of his share to the property expenses after taking deed to the property. 

30. 
In a title search, someone looking up Atwood's name in the grantor index would find no indication that Atwood conveyed the property, and nothing would lead the searcher to Cooper's deed." A deed that is outside the chain of title is called a wild deed. 

31. 
JTWROS deed holders always take the property in equal shares; therefore, if the partnership is dissolved through partition, the proceeds must be equally distributed between all of the co-owners without regard to how much each co-owner contributed to the purchase price of the property. 

32. 
 In some states, joint ownership is presumed to be as tenants in common unless the parties are married and the deed so states or the deed sets for joint tenants with right of survivorship. 

33. 

=== Difference between a deed and an agreement ===
The main difference between a deed and an agreement is that the deed is generally signed by only one person / party. 

34. 
The deed has a greater [[presumption]] of validity and is less [[Rebuttable presumption|rebuttable]] than an instrument signed by the party to the deed. 

35. 
The latter type of deed is usually known as a ''special [[warranty deed]]''.

37. 
A '''deed indented''' or '''indenture'''<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Deed |volume=7 |page=921}}</ref> is one executed in two or more parts according to the number of parties, which were formerly separated by cutting in a curved or indented line known as the chirograph.<ref>{{cite book|first=Frederic Jesup|last=Stimpson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4C8WAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Glossary of Technical Terms, Phrases, and Maxims of the Common Law|section=Deed|location=Boston|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Co.]]|year=1881|page=108|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124154135/http://books.google.com/books?id=4C8WAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|archivedate=2013-01-24}}</ref>  A '''[[deed poll]]''' is one executed in one part, by one party, having the edge polled or cut even, and includes simple grants and appointments. 

38. 
But because the previous deed (the deed from Atwood to Burns) was not recorded, Cooper's deed is outside the chain of title. 

39. 

===Deeds as alternatives to bankruptcy===
* Deed of arrangement – document setting out an arrangement for a debtor to pay part or all outstanding debts, as an alternative to bankruptcy; (Australian law).<ref name="lawbook">{{cite web|title=Glossary|url=http://www2.lawhandbookonline.com.au/content/LHB10-glossary.48.1.html |publisher=Law Handbook Online|accessdate= 11 June 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918044925/http://www2.lawhandbookonline.com.au/content/LHB10-glossary.48.1.html|archivedate=18 September 2009}}</ref>
