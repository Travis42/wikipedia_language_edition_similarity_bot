How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

Humanities

en edition's differences with the id version: 


1. 

====Theatre====
[[Theatre]] (or theater) (Greek "theatron", ''θέατρον'') is the branch of the [[performing arts]] concerned with [[acting]] out stories in front of an audience using combinations of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle — indeed any one or more elements of the other performing arts. 

2. 

===Classics===
[[File:Homeros Caetani Louvre Ma440 n2.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Homer]], the most famous Greek poet]]
[[Classics]], in the [[Western culture|Western]] academic tradition, refers to the studies of the cultures of [[classical antiquity]], namely Ancient Greek and Latin and the Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] cultures. 

3. 
Performing arts include [[acrobatics]], [[busking]], [[comedy]], [[dance]], [[film]], [[magic (illusion)|magic]], [[music]], [[opera]], [[juggling]], [[marching arts]], such as [[brass band]]s, and [[theatre]]. 

4. 

===Performing arts===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}
The [[performing art]]s differ from the [[visual arts]] in so far as the former uses the artist's own body, face, and presence as a medium, and the latter uses materials such as clay, metal, or paint, which can be molded or transformed to create some [[work of art|art object]]. 

5. 
A good deal of twentieth-century and twenty-first-century philosophy has been devoted to the analysis of language and to the question of whether, as [[Wittgenstein]] claimed, many of our philosophical confusions derive from the vocabulary we use; literary theory has explored the rhetorical, associative, and ordering features of language; and historical linguists have studied the development of languages across time. 

6. 
Such arguments appeal to judgments and anxieties about the essential uselessness of the humanities, especially in an age when it is seemingly vitally important for scholars of literature, history and the arts to engage in "collaborative work with experimental scientists or even simply to make "intelligent use of the findings from empirical science."<ref>""Theory," Anti-Theory, and Empirical Criticism," ''Biopoetics: Evolutionary Explorations in the Arts'', Brett Cooke and Frederick Turner, eds., Lexington, Kentucky: ICUS Books, 1999, pp. 

7. 
College-level programs in a [[foreign language]] usually include study of important works of the literature in that language, as well as the language itself. 

8. 
In this argument, then, only the academic pursuit of pleasure can provide a link between the private and the public realm in modern Western consumer society and strengthen that public sphere that, according to many theorists,{{who|date=May 2012}} is the foundation for modern democracy.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Others, like [[Mark Bauerlein]], argue that professors in the humanities have increasingly abandoned proven methods of [[epistemology]] (''I care only about the quality of your arguments, not your conclusions.'') in favor of [[indoctrination]] (''I care only about your conclusions, not the quality of your arguments.''). 

9. 
Law tells many of [[history]]'s stories, because statutes, case law and codifications build up over time. 

10. 
And law is economics, because any rule about [[contract]], [[tort]], [[property law]], [[labour law]], [[company law]] and many more can have long-lasting effects on how productivity is organised and the distribution of wealth. 

11. 

===Law and politics===
[[File:Old Bailey Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|right|A trial at a criminal court, the [[Old Bailey]] in [[London]]]]{{Main|Law}} In common parlance, [[law]] means a rule that (unlike a rule of ethics) is enforceable through institutions.<ref>{{cite book|title=Crimes Against Humanity|first=Geoffrey| last=Robertson| authorlink=Geoffrey Robertson|year=2006| publisher=Penguin|page=90| isbn=978-0-14-102463-9}}</ref> The study of law crosses the boundaries between the social sciences and humanities, depending on one's view of research into its objectives and effects. 

12. 

==Origin of the term==
The word "humanities" is derived from the [[Renaissance Latin]] expression ''studia humanitatis'', or "study of ''[[humanitas]]''" (a classical Latin word meaning—in addition to "humanity"—"culture, refinement, education" and, specifically, an "education befitting a cultivated man"). 

13. 
The word "[[red]]", for example, can cover a wide range of variations on the pure red of the spectrum.

===Visual arts===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}

====History of visual arts====
[[File:Quatrain on Heavenly Mountain.jpg|thumbnail|''Quatrain on Heavenly Mountain'' by [[Emperor Gaozong of Song China|Emperor Gaozong]] (1107–1187) of [[Song Dynasty]]; fan mounted as album leaf on silk, four columns in cursive script.]]
The great traditions in [[art]] have a foundation in the art of one of the ancient civilizations, such as [[Ancient Japan]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[China]], [[Indus Valley Civilization|India]], [[Greater Nepal]], [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Mesoamerica]]. 

18. 

Eastern art has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art, namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade and reflection). 

19. 
Since anthropology arose as a science in Western societies that were complex and industrial, a major trend within anthropology has been a methodological drive to study peoples in societies with more simple social organization, sometimes called "primitive" in anthropological literature, but without any connotation of "inferior".<ref>{{cite book |last=Lowie |first=Robert |title=Primitive Religion |publisher=Routledge and Sons |year=1924}}; {{cite book |last=Tylor |first=Edward |year=1920 |title=Primitive Culture |location=New York |publisher=J.

===Linguistics and languages===
{{Main|Linguistics|Language}}
{{see also2|{{in title|language}}}}
While the scientific study of language is known as [[linguistics]] and is generally considered a [[social science]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://artsandscience.usask.ca/arts-science/socialsciences.php |title=Social Science Majors, University of Saskatchewan |access-date=2016-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906113657/http://artsandscience.usask.ca/arts-science/socialsciences.php |archive-date=2015-09-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> a [[natural science]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~massimo/publications/PDF/BoeckxMPPLingReview2005.pdf|title=Language as a Natural Object; Linguistics as a Natural Science|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723173105/http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~massimo/publications/PDF/BoeckxMPPLingReview2005.pdf|archive-date=2010-07-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> or a [[cognitive science]],<ref name="stanford1">Thagard, Paul, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/cognitive-science/ Cognitive Science], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. 

21. 
[[Poststructuralism]] has problematized an approach to the humanistic study based on questions of meaning, intentionality, and authorship.{{Dubious|date=February 2010}} In the wake of [[Death of the author|the death of the author]] proclaimed by [[Barthes|Roland Barthes]], various theoretical currents such as [[deconstruction]] and [[discourse]] analysis seek to expose the ideologies and rhetoric operative in producing both the purportedly meaningful objects and the [[hermeneutic]] subjects of humanistic study. 

22. 
The noun ''law'' derives from the late [[Old English language|Old English]] ''lagu'', meaning something laid down or fixed,<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=law&searchmode=none Etymonline Dictionary]</ref> and the adjective ''legal'' comes from the Latin word ''LEX''.<ref>[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/legal Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]</ref>

===Literature===
{{main|Literature}}
[[File:First Folio.jpg|thumb|[[Shakespeare]] wrote some of the most acclaimed works in [[English literature]].]] '''Literature''' is a term that does not have a universally accepted definition, but which has variably included all written work; writing that possesses literary merit; and language that foregrounds literariness, as opposed to [[ordinary language]]. 

23. 

Since the early twentieth century, philosophy in English-speaking [[universities]] has moved away from the humanities and closer to the formal sciences, becoming much more ''analytic.'' [[Analytic philosophy]] is marked by emphasis on the use of logic and formal methods of reasoning, conceptual analysis, and the use of [[symbolic logic|symbolic]] and/or [[mathematical logic]], as contrasted with the [[Continental philosophy|Continental style of philosophy]].<ref>See, e.g., Brian Leiter [https://web.archive.org/web/20061115002425/http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/analytic.asp] "'Analytic' philosophy today names a style of doing philosophy, not a philosophical program or a set of substantive views. 

24. 
Anthropology (like some fields of history) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wallerstein | first1 = I. 

25. 
The ''social sciences'' have generally attempted to develop scientific methods to understand social phenomena in a generalizable way, though usually with methods distinct from those of the natural sciences. 

26. 
Literature can be classified according to whether it is [[fiction]] or [[non-fiction]], and whether it is [[poetry]] or [[prose]]; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the [[novel]], [[short story]] or [[drama]]; and works are often categorised according to historical periods, or according to their adherence to certain [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] features or expectations ([[genre]]).

28. 

Archaeology is thought of as a branch of [[anthropology]] in the United States,<ref>{{citation| title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge |first1=William A. 

29. 
Most performance art also involves some form of plastic art, perhaps in the creation of [[Theatrical property|props]]. 

30. 
Modern and contemporary art has moved away from the historic value of craft in favour of [[concept]]; this has led some {{Who|date=June 2011}} to say that painting, as a serious art form, is dead, although this has not deterred the majority of artists from continuing to practise it either as whole or part of their work. 

31. 
When used as the name of a [[field of study]], ''history'' refers to the study and interpretation of the record of [[human]]s, [[society|societies]], institutions, and any topic that has changed over time. 

32. 

===Philosophy===
[[File:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|The works of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] overlap into many fields of the humanities, such as philosophy, literature, theology, music, and classical studies.]]
Philosophy—etymologically, the "love of wisdom"—is generally the study of problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, justification, truth, justice, right and wrong, beauty, validity, mind, and language. 

33. 
Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing these issues by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on reasoned argument, rather than experiments ([[experimental philosophy]] being an exception).<ref>Thomas Nagel (1987). 

34. 
This understanding, they claimed, ties like-minded people from similar cultural backgrounds together and provides a sense of cultural continuity with the philosophical past.<ref>[[Dilthey|Dilthey, Wilhelm]]. 

35. 
[[Technology]] is the practical extension  of the natural sciences, as [[politics]] is the extension of the social sciences.

37. 
For example, the UK [Research Excellence Framework] has been subject to criticism due to its assessment criteria from across the humanities, and indeed, the social sciences.<ref>Palgrave Communications 3, Article number: 17020 (2017)
doi:10.1057/palcomms.2017.20</ref> In particular, the notion of "impact" has generated significant debate.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bulaitis |first1=Zoe |title=Measuring impact in the humanities: Learning from accountability and economics in a contemporary history of cultural value |journal=Palgrave Communications |date=31 October 2017 |volume=3 |issue=1 |doi=10.1057/s41599-017-0002-7}}</ref>

===In Asia===

In [[India]], there are many institutions that offer undergraduate UG or bachelor's degree/diploma and postgraduate PG or master's degree/diploma as well as doctoral PhD and postdoctoral studies and research, in this academic discipline. 

38. 
In Britain, for example, over 11,000 humanities majors found employment in the following occupations:
* Education (25.8%)
* Management (19.8%)
* Media/Literature/Arts (11.4%)
* Law (11.3%)
* Finance (10.4%)
* Civil service (5.8%)
* Not-for-profit (5.2%)
* Marketing (2.3%)
* Medicine (1.7%)
* Other (6.4%)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://torch.ox.ac.uk/sites/torch/files/publications/Humanities%20Graduates%20and%20the%20British%20Economy%20-%20University%20of%20Oxford.pdf|title=Humanities graduates and the British economy: The hidden impact|last=Kreager|first=Philip|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>
Many humanities graduates finish university with no career goals in mind.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Adamuti-Trache|display-authors=etal|first=Maria|year=2006|title=The Labour Market Value of Liberal Arts and Applied Education Programs: Evidence from British Columbia|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/cjhe/index.php/cjhe/article/view/183539/183484|journal=Canadian Journal of Higher Education|volume=36|pages=49–74|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Thought Vlogger|title=What can you do with a humanities degree?|date=2018-08-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnJbi2Fiiz8|access-date=2018-08-07}}</ref> Consequently, many spend the first few years after graduation deciding what to do next, resulting in lower incomes at the start of their career; meanwhile, graduates from career-oriented programs experience more rapid entry into the labour market. 

39. 
Today, the humanities are more frequently contrasted with natural, and sometimes [[social sciences]], as well as professional training.<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary 3rd Edition}}</ref>

The humanities use methods that are primarily [[Critical theory|critical]], or [[Continental philosophy|speculative]], and have a significant historical element<ref name=oed/>—as distinguished from the mainly [[Empirical method|empirical]] approaches of the [[natural science]]s,<ref name=oed>"Humanity" 2.b, ''Oxford English Dictionary'' 3rd Ed. 

40. 

===History===
[[History]] is systematically collected [[information]] about the [[past]]. 

41. 
Gilbert argues "First of all, there is a very successful alternative to science as a commercialized march to “progress.” This is the approach taken by the liberal arts college, a model that takes pride in seeing science in context and in integrating science with the humanities and social sciences."<ref>Gilbert, S. 

42. 

==Today==

=== Education and employment ===
For many decades, there has been a growing public perception that a humanities education inadequately prepares graduates for employment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hersh|first=Richard H.|date=1997-03-01|title=Intention and Perceptions A National Survey of Public Attitudes Toward Liberal Arts Education|journal=Change: The Magazine of Higher Learning|volume=29|issue=2|pages=16–23|doi=10.1080/00091389709603100|issn=0009-1383}}</ref> The common belief is that graduates from such programs face underemployment and incomes too low for a humanities education to be worth the investment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/03/27/hooray_for_worthless_education/|title=Hooray for "worthless" education!|last=Williams|first=Mary Elizabeth|website=Salon|access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref>

In fact, humanities graduates find employment in a wide variety of management and professional occupations.
