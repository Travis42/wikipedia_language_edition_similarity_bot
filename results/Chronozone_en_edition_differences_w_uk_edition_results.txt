Chronozone
en edition's differences with the uk version: 
1.86265e-09
Some accepted chronozones contain others, and certain larger chronozones have been designated which span whole defined geological time units, both large and small
0.1038
According to the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]], the term "chronozone" refers to the rocks formed during a particular time period, while "chron" refers to that time period.<ref>

Identification and acceptance of chronozones as useful markers or benchmarks of time in the [[rock record]], are non-hierarchical in that chronozones do not need to correspond across geographic or geologic boundaries, nor be equal in length (despite an early constraint that one be defined as smaller than a [[stage (geology)|geological stage]])
