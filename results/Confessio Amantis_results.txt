While Macaulay (1901: x-xxi, 1908: sec 28) was cautiously grateful, his contemporary Crawshaw (1907:61) attributed to the work ''certain lack of vigour or lack of vigour, and a fatal inability to comprehend when he said enough'

In the genre it is considered a "poem of consolation", a medieval form inspired by the [[Consolation of Philosophy]] of [[Boecio]] and exemplified by works such as Pearl

Pearsall (2004:94) assigns a "doubtful state" to Macaulay's "second recession" and has other comments on Macaulay's tally of the text

Even excluding the shortest, there are more than 100 individual stories (Macaulay 1908: sec 24), which make them more numerous than the strict 100 of [Decameron], and much more than [[Canterbury's Tales]] or "'The Legend of Good Women'"

Chaucer, which must also have grown up using some form ''-nde'' (''-ande'' or ''-ende''), adopted the more progressive ''-ynge'', but Gower's persistence with ''-ende'' can be explained only by reference to the [Suffolk] stratum in its language.</blockquote>
Smith (2004:65) concludes that despite these regional characteristics "Gower was evidently part of London's language community of the late [14th century]"

A treatise from the [15th century] printed by Caxton describes "his books, called Confessionalle" as

:''Ful of sentence / set ful fructuosly''
:'That hym to rede / shal gyue you corage''
:'He is so ful of fruyt, sentence and langage''

( Book of Curtesye , 327-329: Furnivall 1868)
In some cases, he is praised and condemned at the same time; Jonson (1640) considers him dangerously attractive and can harm young writers who might be tempted to imitate his style:

This version of the work had widespread circulation, perhaps due to its royal connections (Peck 2000), and was the most popular of Gower's works, with at least 32 of the 49 existing manuscripts of the ''Confessio'' containing this version
0.0397072
The ''Confessio'' is divided into a prologue and eight books, which are divided thematically
0.0397072
According to the traditional system, the final sin should be [lust], but since this cannot be considered a sin against Venus, the subject of the last book comes down to the only perversion of [incest]

The ''Confessio'' was apparently popular in its own time; his 49 surviving manuscripts suggest a popularity halfway between Chaucer's [Canterbury Tales] (80 copies) and ''Troilus and Criseyde'' (16 copies)
0.0397073
It has been suggested that it was the influence of Chaucer, who partly dedicated his ''Troilus and Criseyde'' to Gower, which convinced him that the vernacular was a proper language for poetry, and the influence of Chaucer's ''Legend of Good Women'' was detected in the ''Confessio' (Macaulay 1908: sec 23)

The first known critique is an apparent reference in Chaucer's "Man of the Law Prologue": the Man of the same name, praising Chaucer, observes that

:''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no word ne writeth he''
:''Of thilke wikke ensample of Canacee''
:''That loved hir owene brotherly synfully&mdash;''
:''Of swiche cursed stories I say fy!&mdash;''
:'Or ellis of Tyro Appollonius,''
:'How that the cursed kyng Antiochus''
:'Birafte his doghter of hir maydenhede,''
:'That is so horrible a tale for to rede''

The source he trusts the most is [[Ovid]], whose work [The Metamorphosis] was somewhata popular source of examples; others include the [Bible]] and several other classical and medieval writers, of which Macaulay (1908: sec 29) lists [[Maximum Valerio]], Statius, [[Beno't de Sainte-Maure]] with the [Trojan Poem]], [[Guido delle Colonne]] (Historia destructionis Troiae), [[Godfredo de Viterbo], [[Brunetto Latini]], [[Nicholas Trivet], the [Seven Wise Men of Greece]], the Vita Barlaam and Josaphat,] and the Story of [Alexander the Great]]

According to Macaulay (1901:xxii), a second recession was issued around 1392, with some significant changes: most notably most references to Richard as well as dedication to Chaucer were eliminated, and these are replaced with a new dedication to [[Henry of Lancaster]], the future king [[Henry IV of England]]

In this context, the plan of the work presented in the prologue is one of the most cited passages of the poem:
:'Bot for men sein, and soth it is,''
:'That who that al of wisdom writ''
:'It dulleth ofte a mannes wit''
:'To him that schal it aldai rede,''
:'For thilke cause, if that ye rede,''
:'I wolde go the middel weie''
:'And wryte a bok betwen the tweie,''
:'Somewhat of lust, somewhat of lore...''

Despite this, it is more commonly studied along with other collections of short stories with similar structures, such as [[Boccaccio]'s [[Boccaccio]] and, in particular, Chaucer's [Canterbury's Tales]], with which the 'Confessio' has several stories in common
0.0496341
The narrative structure overlaps this on three levels: external matter, the narrative framework, and the individual narratives that make up most of the work

Lewis], who, while admitring that the work may be "prosaic" and "boring" in some places, identifies a "sweetness and freshness" in the verse and praises its "memorable precision and weight" (Lewis 1936:201)

Lewis, who has been quoted earlier admiring the style of work, was unconvinced by its structure, describing the epilogue as ''a long and undenturated coda'' (Lewis 1936: 222)

The ''Apollonius'' is almost 2000 lines in length but, at the other extreme, the distinction between the tale and the allusion is difficult to define since the summaries of the story of ''Troilus and Criseide'' appear in three places (II.2456-2458, IV.7597-7602, VIII.2531-2535), but none can actually be described as 'story'

The design is that each book of the poem will be devoted to a single sin, and the first six books follow the traditional order of the first six sins: [[Sober]], [[Enviance]], [[ira]], [[laziness]], [[avaitation]], and [gula]]

At this point, however, Gower breaks his form and his ramblings: at the end of Book 6, ''Amans'' asks that Genius give him a break from confession and teach him wisdom, and Genius responds in Book 7 by speaking at length about the education given by [Aristotle]] to [Alexander the Great]]

"'''Confessio Amantis'"'', in [English or English language]] ''The Lover's Confession'' is a poem of 33&amp;000 verses in English written by [[John Gower]], which uses confession made by an elderly lover to the chaplain of [Venus (mythology)" Venus]] as a frame story for a collection of shorter narrative poems

Gower's vocabulary is polite, with extensive use of loans in French and Latin, some of them seemingly original; for example, the ''Confessio'' is the oldest work in which the word ''history'' is certified in English (OED also Middle English Dictionary)

Although not of great importance as a source of later works, the ''Confessio'' is nevertheless significant in itself as one of the first poems written in a form of English that is clearly recognizable as a direct precursor to the modern standard and, above all, as one of the few works that laid the foundations for the literary prestige on which modern English literature is based
