Chronon
en edition's differences with the ja version: 
0.0519174
Caldirola's original paper has a different formula due to not working in standard units.</ref>

From this formula, it can be seen that the nature of the moving particle being considered must be specified since the value of the chronon depends on the particle's charge and mass

 Consequently, the value of the chronon, like other quantized observables in quantum mechanics, is a function of the system under consideration, particularly its boundary conditions.<ref>Farias & Recami, p.18.</ref> The value for the chronon, ''θ''<sub>0</sub>, is calculated from:

:<math>\theta_0=\frac{1}{6\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{e^2}{m_0c^3}\ </math><ref>Farias & Recami, p.11

Caldirola claims the chronon has important implications for quantum mechanics, in particular that it allows for a clear answer to the question of whether a free-falling charged particle does or does not emit radiation.{{clarify|date=February 2014}} This model supposedly avoids the difficulties met by Abraham–[[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]]'s{{which|date=February 2014}} and [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]]'s approaches{{which|date=February 2014}} to the problem, and provides a natural explication of [[quantum decoherence]].<!--I assume these were Caldirola's claims, not merely the claims of some anonymous Wikipedia editor
