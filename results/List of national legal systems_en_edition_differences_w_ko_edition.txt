List of national legal systems

en edition's differences with the ko version: 


1. 
The present Civil Code went into effect 1 January 1888, and was influenced by the [[Napoleonic Code]] and the Spanish Civil Code of 1889 (from its 1851 draft version). 

2. 
Beyond the influence of the Spanish legal tradition, the Argentinian Civil Code was also inspired by the Draft of the Brazilian Civil Code, the [[wikt:Draft|Draft]] of the Spanish Civil Code of 1851, the [[Napoleonic code]] and the [[Civil Code (Chile)|Chilean Civil Code]]. 

3. 
On its turn, the Chilean civil code influenced to a large degree the drafting of the civil codes of other [[Latin-American]] states. 

4. 
 The civil code of the [[Republic of Turkey]] is a slightly modified version of the Swiss code, adopted in 1926 during [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]'s presidency as part of the government's progressive reforms and secularization. 

5. 
This Civil Code has suffered some reforms throughout the years, as well as a few derogations relating to areas which have subsequently been regulated by newer laws, such as the Code of Commerce and the Law of the National Registry of Persons. 

6.

7. 
In some cases these are intended purely as individual moral guidance, whereas in other cases they are intended and may be used as the basis for a country's legal system. 

8. 
Descended from the [[Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Civil Code of the Austrian Empire]] (1811), influenced by German (1939–45) and Soviet (1947/68–89) legal codes during occupation periods, substantially reformed to remove Soviet influence and elements of [[socialist law]] after the [[Velvet Revolution]] (1989). 

9. 
Although jurisprudence technically refers to judicial decisions in general, in practice it tends to be confused and identified with the concept of 'legal doctrine', which is a qualified series of identical resolutions in similar cases pronounced by higher courts (the Constitutional Court acting as a 'Tribunal de [[Amparo (law)|Amparo]]', and the Supreme Court acting as a 'Tribunal de Casación') whose theses become binding for lower courts. 

10. 
Canon law is amended and adapted by the legislative authority of the church, such as [[episcopal conference|councils of bishops]], individual bishops for their respective sees, the [[Pope]] for the entire Catholic Church, and the British Parliament for the [[Church of England]]. 

11. 
An 1891 proclamation by the [[High Commissioner for Southern Africa]] applied the law of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] (now part of South Africa) to [[Southern Rhodesia]] (now Zimbabwe). 

12. 
over Spain in the Spanish–American War of 1898 and cession of Puerto Rico to the U.S.); federal laws (based on common law) are in effect because of federal Supremacy Clause. 

13. 

The Argentinian Civil Code was also in effect in Paraguay, as per a [[Paraguayan]] law of 1880, until the new Civil Code went in force in 1987. 

14. 
Based on the Civil Code of Quebec, but also influenced by the Napoleonic Code and other French-inspired codes (such as those of Italy, Spain and Switzerland)<ref>{{cite book |title=Drept civil. 

15. 
[[Civil Code of the Republic of Korea|Korean Civil Code]] was introduced 1958 and fully enacted by 1960. 

16. 
However, neither Sweden, nor any other Nordic state created a civil code of the kind of the ''Code Civil'' or the BGB. 

17. 
Germanic traditional laws and influenced by Medieval Norwegian and Danish laws. 

18. 
One of the most fundamental documents to shape common law is the English [[Magna Carta]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Magna Carta|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html|accessdate=10 November 2006}}</ref> which placed limits on the power of the English Kings. 

19. 

However, some of these legal systems are often and more correctly said to be of hybrid nature:
*'''Napoleonic to Germanistic influence ([[Italian law|Italian civil law]]) '''
The [[Italy|Italian]] civil code of 1942 replaced the original one of 1865, introducing germanistic elements due to the geopolitical alliances of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.teoriaestoriadeldirittoprivato.com/index.php?com=statics&option=index&cID=132 |title = Towards a Civil Code: The Italian Experience|last = Triggiano|first = Annalisa|website = Teoria e Storia del Diritto Privato}}</ref> The Italian approach has been imitated by other countries including [[Portugal]] (1966), the [[Netherlands]] (1992), [[Lithuania]] (2000), [[Brazil]] (2002) and [[Argentina]] (2014). 

20. 
First Civil Code (a part of the General Code or [[Braulio Carrillo Colina|Carrillo]] Code) came into effect in 1841; its text was inspired by the South Peruvian Civil Code of Marshal [[Andres de Santa Cruz]]. 

21. 

In Argentina, this 1871 Civil Code remained in force until August 2015, when it was replaced by the new ''Código Civil y Comercial de la Nación''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/235000-239999/235975/norma.htm |title=Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas Públicas - Argentina |publisher=InfoLEG |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jornadaonline.com/Pol%C3%ADtica/139234-Comienza-a-regir-el-nuevo-C%C3%B3digo-Civil-y-Comercial |title=Comienza a regir el nuevo Código Civil y Comercial |publisher=Jornadaonline.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}</ref>

During the second half of the 20th century, the [[German law|German]] legal theory became increasingly influential in Argentina. 

22. 
Most of them have innovations introduced by the Italian legislation, including the unification of the [[civil code|civil]] and [[Commercial code (law)|commercial code]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol16/iss2/8/ |title = On the Legal Method of the Uniform Commercial Code|journal = Law and Contemporary Problems|volume = 16|number = 2|first= Mitchell|last= Franklin|date = Spring 1951|pages = 330–343}}</ref>

*'''Germanistic to Napoleonic influence ([[Swiss law|Swiss civil law]])'''
The [[Swiss civil code]] is considered mainly influenced by the German civil code and partly influenced by the French civil code. 

23. 
The Greek [[civil code]] of 1946, highly influenced by traditional Roman law and the German civil code of 1900 ([[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]); the Greek civil code replaced the [[Byzantine law|Byzantine–Roman civil law]] in effect in Greece since its independence (Νομική Διάταξη της Ανατολικής Χέρσου Ελλάδος, Legal Provision of Eastern Mainland Greece, November 1821: 'Οι Κοινωνικοί Νόμοι των Αειμνήστων Χριστιανών Αυτοκρατόρων της Ελλάδος μόνοι ισχύουσι κατά το παρόν εις την Ανατολικήν Χέρσον Ελλάδα', 'The Social [i.e.

Both ''civil'' (also known as ''Roman'') and ''common'' law systems can be considered the most widespread in the world: civil law because it is the most widespread by landmass and by population overall, and common law because it is employed by the greatest number of people compared to any single civil law system.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Phillip|title=''Principles of International Insolvency''|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f_yWaV_-_l4C&lpg=PT454&ots=D-khdgPbR4&dq=maps%20of%20world%20financial%20law%20common%20law&pg=PT454#v=onepage&q=maps%20of%20world%20financial%20law%20common%20law&f=false|date=2007|publisher=Sweet & Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Phillip|title=''Maps of World Financial Law:Law and practice of international finance series''|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Maps_of_World_Financial_Law.html?id=Z5vKGAAACAAJ|date=2008|publisher=Sweet & Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''English Common Law is the most widespread legal system in the world''|url=https://www.sweetandmaxwell.co.uk/about-us/press-releases/061108.pdf|date=November 2008|publisher=Sweet & Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref>
