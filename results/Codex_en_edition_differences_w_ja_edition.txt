How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

Codex

en edition's differences with the ja version: 


1. 
Despite this comparison, a fragment of a non-Christian parchment codex of [[Demosthenes]]' ''De Falsa Legatione'' from [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri|Oxyrhynchus]] in Egypt demonstrates that the surviving evidence is insufficient to conclude whether Christians played a major or central role in the development of early codices—or if they simply adopted the format to distinguish themselves from [[Jews]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The earliest surviving fragments from codices come from Egypt, and are variously dated (always tentatively) towards the end of the 1st century or in the first half of the 2nd. 

2. 
The [[parchment]] notebook pages were commonly washed or scraped for re-use (called a [[palimpsest]]) and consequently, writings in a codex were often considered informal and impermanent.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

As early as the early 2nd century, there is evidence that a codex—usually of [[papyrus]]—was the preferred format among [[Christianity|Christians]].

==Etymology and origins==
[[File:The War Scroll - Dead Sea Scroll.jpg|thumb|Codices largely replaced scrolls similar to this.]]

The word codex comes from the [[Latin]] word ''caudex'', meaning "trunk of a tree", “block of wood” or “book”). 

4. 
 Some codices are continuously folded like a [[concertina]], in particular the [[Maya codices]] and [[Aztec codices]], which are actually long sheets of paper or animal skin folded into pages. 

5. 
In fact, any combination of codices and scrolls with papyrus and parchment is technically feasible and common in the historical record.<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|p=5}}</ref>

Technically, even modern [[paperback]]s are codices, but publishers and scholars reserve the term for [[manuscript]] (hand-written) books produced from [[Late antiquity]] until the [[Middle Ages]]. 

6. 
[[New World]] codices were written as late as the 16th century (see [[Maya codices]] and [[Aztec codices]]). 

7. 
Once threaded together, the scribe would then sew a line of parchment up the "spine" of the manuscript, as to protect the tacking.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Those written before the Spanish conquests seem all to have been single long sheets folded [[concertina]]-style, sometimes written on both sides of the local ''[[amatl]]'' paper. 

10. 
To prevent tearing, the maker wraps the area of the skin attached to the cord around a pebble called a pippin.<ref name="Intro" /> After completing that, the maker uses a crescent shaped knife called a ''lunarium'' or ''lunellum'' to remove any remaining hairs.

In his discussion of one of the earliest parchment codices to survive from [[Oxyrhynchus]] in Egypt, Eric Turner seems to challenge Skeat's notion when stating, “…its mere existence is evidence that this book form had a prehistory”, and that “early experiments with this book form may well have taken place outside of Egypt.”<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Eric|title=The Typology of the Early Codex|year=1977|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8122-7696-1 |page=38}}</ref> Early codices of parchment or papyrus appear to have been widely used as personal notebooks, for instance in recording copies of letters sent (Cicero ''Fam.'' 9.26.1).

 These do not really meet most current definitions of the "codex" form, but are so called by convention.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] developed the form from [[wax tablets]]. 

13. 
Three of these books are specifically described by Martial as being in the form of a codex; the poet praises the compendiousness of the form (as opposed to the scroll), as well the convenience with which such a book can be read on a journey. 

14. 
Though most early codices were made of [[papyrus]], papyrus was fragile and supplies from Egypt, the only place where papyrus grew and was made into paper, became scanty. 

15. 
 The book is usually bound by stacking the pages and fixing one edge to a spine, which may just be thicker paper ([[paperback]] or [[softback]]), or with stiff boards, called a [[hardback]], or in elaborate historical examples a [[treasure binding]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

At least in the Western world, the main alternative to the paged codex format for a long document is the continuous [[scroll]], which was the dominant form of document in the [[Ancient World]].

There were intermediate stages, such as scrolls folded [[concertina]]-style and pasted together at the back and books that were printed only on one side of the paper.<ref>[http://idp.bl.uk/education/bookbinding/bookbinding.a4d [[International Dunhuang Project]]—Several intermediate Chinese bookbinding forms from the 10th century].</ref> This replaced traditional Chinese writing mediums such as [[bamboo and wooden slips]], as well as [[History of silk|silk]] and paper scrolls.<ref>{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|page=227|postscript=.}}</ref> The evolution of the codex in [[History of China|China]] began with folded-leaf [[pamphlet]]s in the 9th century, during the late [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907), improved by the 'butterfly' bindings of the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279), the wrapped back binding of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271-1368), the stitched binding of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] (1368-1644) and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties (1644-1912), and finally the adoption of Western-style bookbinding in the 20th century.<ref name="Cambridge University Press">{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|pages=227–229|postscript=.}}</ref> The initial phase of this evolution, the accordion-folded palm-leaf-style book, most likely came from [[India]] and was introduced to China via [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist missionaries and scriptures]].<ref name="Cambridge University Press"/>
