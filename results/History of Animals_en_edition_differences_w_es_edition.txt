History of Animals

en edition's differences with the es version: 


1. 
This is an instance of a [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]]: if something is a bird, it will have [[feather]]s and [[wing]]s; if something has feathers and wings, that also implies it is a bird, so the reasoning here is bidirectional. 

2. 
Thus, Philippa Lang argues, Aristotle may have been [[empiricism|empirical]], but he was quite [[laissez-faire]] about observation, "because [he] was not expecting nature to be misleading".<ref name=Lang2015/>

In other cases, errors may have been wrongly attributed to Aristotle.<ref name=Wilkins>{{cite web |last1=Wilkins |first1=John S. 

3. 
Aristotle investigates four types of differences between animals: differences in particular body parts (Books I to IV); differences in ways of life and types of activity (Books V, VI, VII and IX); and differences in specific characters (Book VIII).<ref name=Lennox/>

To illustrate the philosophical method, consider one grouping of many kinds of animal,  '[[birds]]': all members of this group possess the same distinguishing features—feathers, wings, beaks, and two bony legs. 

4. 
Wilkins notes that Aristotle did not say "all flies have four legs"; he wrote that one particular animal, the ''ephemeron'' or [[mayfly]], "moves with four feet and four wings: and, I may observe in passing, this creature is exceptional not only in regard to the duration of its existence, whence it receives its name, but also because though a quadruped it has wings also." Mayflies do in fact walk on four legs, the front pair not being adapted for walking, so, Wilkins concludes, Aristotle was correct.<ref name=Wilkins/>

Like other classical authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]], Aristotle also gathered evidence from travellers and people with specialised knowledge, such as fishermen and [[beekeeper]]s, without much attempt to corroborate what they said.<ref name=Lang2015>{{cite book |last=Lang |first=Philippa |title=Science: Antiquity and its Legacy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OzDPCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT60 |year=2015 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-0-85773-955-1 |pages=60–63}}</ref>

===Apparent errors===

The text contains some claims that appear to be errors. 

6. 
It was written in the fourth century BC; Aristotle died in 322 BC. 

7. 
This implies, in Aristotle's reasoning, that if something has lungs, it has red blood; but Aristotle is careful not to imply that all red-blooded animals have lungs, so the reasoning here is not bidirectional.<ref name=Lennox/>

Aristotle described the embryological development of a chick; he distinguished whales and dolphins from fish; he described the chambered stomachs of ruminants and the social organization of bees; he noticed that some sharks give birth to live young — his books on animals are filled with such observations, some of which were not confirmed until many centuries later.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Waggoner |first1=Ben |title=Aristotle (384-322 B.C.E.) |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/aristotle.html |publisher=[[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] |accessdate=27 November 2014 |date=9 June 1996}}</ref>}}

[[Walter Pagel]] comments that Aristotle "perceptibly influenced" the founders of modern zoology, the Swiss [[Conrad Gessner]] with his 1551–1558 ''[[Historiae animalium (Gesner)|Historiae animalium]]'', the Italian [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]] (1522–1605), the French [[Guillaume Rondelet]] (1507–1566), and the Dutch [[Volcher Coiter]] (1534–1576), while his methods of looking at time series and making use of [[comparative anatomy]] assisted the Englishman [[William Harvey]] in his 1651 work on embryology.<ref name="Pagel1967">{{cite book|author=Walter Pagel |title=William Harvey's Biological Ideas: Selected Aspects and Historical Background |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m0cQQlZK43cC&pg=PA335 |year=1967 |publisher=Karger Medical and Scientific Publishers |isbn=978-3-8055-0962-6|page=335}}</ref>

Aristotle's methods of observation included [[dissection]] (Aristotle's lost companion work, ''The Dissections'', contained illustrations of these<ref name=Haworth>{{cite book |last=Haworth |first=Alan |title=Understanding the Political Philosophers: From Ancient to Modern Times |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZUWqnGiTfsC&pg=PA37 |year=2011 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-1-135-19896-1 |pages=37–40}}</ref>), so he observed animal [[anatomy]] directly, though his interpretations of the functions of the structures he observed were subject to error.

For example, he recorded that male octopuses have a [[hectocotylus]], a [[tentacle]] which stores [[sperm]] and which can transfer it into the female's body; sometimes it snaps off during mating.<ref>Aristotle, Book IV.I (D'Arcy Thompson, page 524)</ref> The account was dismissed as fanciful until the French naturalist [[Georges Cuvier]] described it in his 1817 ''[[Le Règne Animal]]''.<ref name=Allaby>{{cite book |last=Allaby |first=Michael |title=Animals: From Mythology to Zoology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtKZ12YN9qcC&pg=PT34 |year=2010 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-0-8160-6101-3 |pages=34–}}</ref> Aristotle also noted that the young of the [[Mustelus canis|dogfish]] grow inside their mother's body attached by a cord to something like a [[placenta]] (a yolk sac).

The comparative anatomist [[Richard Owen]] said in 1837 that "Zoological Science sprang from [Aristotle's] labours, we may almost say, like [[Minerva]] from the Head of [[Jupiter|Jove]], in a state of noble and splendid maturity".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Owen |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Sloan|editor1-first=Phillip Reid|title=The Hunterian Lectures in Comparative Anatomy (May and June 1837) |date=1992 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |page=91}}</ref>

Ben Waggoner of the [[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] wrote that

{{quote|Though Aristotle's work in zoology was not without errors, it was the grandest biological synthesis of the time, and remained the ultimate authority for many centuries after his death.
