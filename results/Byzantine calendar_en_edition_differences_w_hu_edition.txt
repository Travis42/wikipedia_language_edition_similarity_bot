The Byzantine World Era was gradually replaced in the [[Orthodox Church]] by the Christian Era (Anno Domini), which was utilized initially by Patriarch [[Theophanes I Karykes]] in 1597, afterwards by Patriarch [[Cyril Lucaris]] in 1626, and then formally established by the Church in 1728.<ref name=ΘΗΕ/>{{#tag:ref|{{in lang|el}} "Εἰς ὅλα τὰ πατριαρχικὰ ἕγγραφα μέχρι Φεβρ.

==Accounts in Byzantine authors==

From [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s decree in AD 537 that all dates must include the [[Indiction]], the unification of the theological date of creation (as yet unfinalized) with the administrative system of Indiction cycles became commonly referred to amongst Byzantine authors, to whom the indiction was the standard measurement of time.

Currently the two dominant dates for creation that exist using the biblical model, are about 5500 BC and about 4000 BC.
