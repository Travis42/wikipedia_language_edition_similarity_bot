=== Critiques ===

Several critiques have been placed against the traditional concept of behavioral modernity, both methodologically and philosophically.<ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003" /><ref name="Shea 2011" /> Shea (2011) outlines a variety of problems with this concept, arguing instead for "behavioral variability", which, according to the author, better describes the archaeological record
0.116635
Since the first Cro-Magnon expansion into Europe around 48,000 years ago is generally accepted as already "modern",<ref name="Hoffecker 2009" /> the question becomes whether behavioral modernity appeared in Africa well before 50,000 years ago, as a late Upper Paleolithic "revolution" which prompted migration out of Africa, or arose outside Africa and diffused back
