The part ''-litica'' simply names the Stone Age as the point from which the transition began and is not another ''-lithic'' age.<ref name=":0" />

Subsequently, British scholars used either Evans's "Copper Age" or the term "Eneolithic" (or Æneolithic), a translation of Chierici's ''eneo-litica''

The Chalcolithic was seen as a new ''-lithic'' age, a part of the [[Stone Age]] in which copper was used, which may appear paradoxical

Networks of exchange and specialized processing and production that had evolved during the Neolithic seem to have collapsed by the Middle Chalcolithic ({{circa}} 4500–3500&nbsp;BC) and been replaced by the use of local materials by a primarily household-based production of stone tools.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fazeli|first1=H.|last2=Donahue|first2=R.E.|last3=Coningham|first3=R.A.E.|title=Stone Tool Production, Distribution and Use during the Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic on the Tehran Plain, Iran|journal=Journal of Persian Studies|date=2002|volume=40|pages=1–14|jstor=4300616}}</ref>

Today, ''Copper Age'', ''Eneolithic'' and ''Chalcolithic'' are used synonymously to mean Evans's original definition of Copper Age.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} The literature of European archaeology in general avoids the use of "Chalcolithic" (the term "Copper Age" is preferred), whereas [[Middle East]]ern archaeologists regularly use it
