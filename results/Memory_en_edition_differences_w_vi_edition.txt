Research reported in 2013 revealed that it is possible to artificially stimulate prior memories and artificially implant false memories in mice. 

29. 
 The researchers found that the people who were asked, "How fast were the cars going when they ''smashed'' into each other?" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, "How fast were the cars going when they ''hit'' each other?"  Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they had seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with ''smashed'' were twice more likely to report that they had seen broken glass than those who had been asked the question with ''hit''. 

30. 
 The pattern of induced and repressed genes in brain neurons subsequent to an intense learning event likely provides the molecular basis for a long-term memory of the event. 

31. 
 To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974)<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Loftus EF, Palmer JC|title=Reconstruction of automobile destruction: An example of the interaction between language and memory |journal=Journal of Verbal Learning & Verbal Behavior |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=585–589 |year=1974 |doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(74)80011-3}}</ref> in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. 

32. 
 The researchers found that one-fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children.

35. 
 Importantly, the wording of the question led people to construct different memories of the event – those who were asked the question with ''smashed'' recalled a more serious car accident than they had actually seen.

==Stress==
Stress has a significant effect on memory formation and learning. 

37. 
 For instance, Goff and Roediger<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Goff LM, Roediger HL|title=Imagination inflation for action events: Repeated imaginings lead to illusory recollections |journal=Memory and Cognition |volume=26 |pages=20–33 |year=1998 |doi=10.3758/bf03211367|doi-access=free }}</ref> (1998) asked participants to imagine that they performed an act (e.g., break a toothpick) and then later asked them whether they had done such a thing. 

38. 
 Twenty-four hours later, both groups were tested to see how many words they could remember (free recall) as well as how many they could recognize from a larger list of words (recognition performance).

Encoding of [[working memory]] involves the spiking of individual neurons induced by sensory input, which persists even after the sensory input disappears (Jensen and Lisman 2005; Fransen et al. 

44. 

Short-term memory is supported by transient patterns of neuronal communication, dependent on regions of the [[frontal lobe]] (especially dorsolateral [[prefrontal cortex]]) and the [[parietal lobe]]. 

45. 
 Key epigenetic mechanisms involved in memory include the [[DNA methylation|methylation]] and [[DNA demethylation|demethylation]] of neuronal DNA, as well as modifications of [[histone]] proteins including [[histone methylation|methylations]], [[histone acetylation and deacetylation|acetylations and deacetylations]].

==Study techniques==
===To assess infants===

Infants do not have the language ability to report on their memories and so verbal reports cannot be used to assess very young children's memory.

  All participants in the experiment, both stressed and unstressed, performed faster when the learning and retrieval contexts were similar.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwabe|first1=L.|last2=Bohringer|first2=A.|last3=Wolf|first3=O.T.|title=Stress disrupts context-dependent memory|journal=[[Learning and Memory]]|year=2009|volume=16|issue=2|pages=110–113|doi=10.1101/lm.1257509|pmid=19181616|doi-access=free}}</ref>

This research on the [[effects of stress on memory]] may have practical implications for education, for eyewitness testimony and for psychotherapy:  students may perform better when tested in their regular classroom rather than an exam room, eyewitnesses may recall details better at the scene of an event than in a courtroom, and persons suffering from [[post-traumatic stress]] may improve when helped to situate their [[memories of a traumatic event]] in an appropriate context.

In order to maximize the benefit to cost ratio, the plant enables a rudimentary form of memory in which two trigger hairs must be stimulated within 30 seconds in order to result in trap closure.<ref name=":1" /> This system ensures that the trap only closes when potential prey is within grasp. 

53. 
 The findings of this experiment were replicated around the world, and researchers consistently demonstrated that when people were provided with misleading information they tended to misremember, a phenomenon known as the [[misinformation effect]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Loftus GR |title=When a lie becomes memory's truth: Memory distortion after exposure to misinformation |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=121–123 |year=1992 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10769035}}</ref>

60. 

Techniques used to assess infants' recognition memory include the following:
* '''Visual paired comparison procedure (relies on habituation)''': infants are first presented with pairs of visual stimuli, such as two black-and-white photos of human faces, for a fixed amount of time; then, after being familiarized with the two photos, they are presented with the "familiar" photo and a new photo. 

61. 
The amount of attention given new stimuli can diminish the amount of information that becomes encoded for storage.<ref name="Eysenck 2012" /> Also, the storage process can become corrupted by physical damage to areas of the brain that are associated with memory storage, such as the hippocampus.<ref name="Squire pp.

Short-term memory is believed to rely mostly on an acoustic code for storing information, and to a lesser extent a visual code.

67. 
This method of remembering telephone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits; this is because we are able to chunk the information into meaningful groups of numbers. 

68. 
 This may be reflected in some countries in the tendency to display telephone numbers as several chunks of two to four numbers.

   The memory performance of subjects who experienced stress during the object-location task decreased significantly when they were tested in an unfamiliar room without the vanilla scent (an incongruent context);  however, the memory performance of stressed subjects showed no impairment when they were tested in the original room with the vanilla scent (a congruent context).

Attention plays a key role in storing information into long-term memory; without proper attention, the information might not be stored, making it impossible to be retrieved later.
