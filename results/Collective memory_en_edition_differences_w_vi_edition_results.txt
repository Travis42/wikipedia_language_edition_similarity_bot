Personal accountability – drawing attention to one's own performance and contribution in a group – also did not reduce collaborative inhibition

===Cognitive mechanisms underlying collaborative recall===
Certain cognitive mechanisms involved during group recall and the interactions between these mechanisms have been suggested to contribute to the formation of collective memory
0.0201794
This mechanism has been studied using the [[Retrieval-induced forgetting|socially shared retrieval induced forgetting]] paradigm, a variation of the [[Retrieval-induced forgetting|retrieval induced forgetting method]] with individuals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coman |first=Alin |last2=Manier |first2=David |last3=Hirst |first3=William |date=May 2009 |title=Forgetting the unforgettable through conversation: socially shared retrieval-induced forgetting of September 11 memories |journal=Psychological Science |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=627–633 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02343.x|issn=1467-9280|pmid=19476592}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coman |first=Alin |last2=Hirst |first2=William |date=August 2015 |title=Social identity and socially shared retrieval-induced forgetting: The effects of group membership |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology

====Re-exposure effects====
Listening to group members recall the previously encoded information can enhance memory as it provides a second exposure opportunity to the information.<ref name=":4" />

====Forgetting====
Studies have shown that information forgotten and excluded during group recall can promote the forgetting of related information compared to information unrelated to that which was excluded during group recall

====Collaborative inhibition and retrieval disruption====
When groups collaborate to recall information, they experience collaborative inhibition, a decrease in performance compared to the pooled memory recall of an equal number of individuals

In another study where American's from the 50 states were asked similar questions regarding their state's contribution to the history of the United States, patterns of overestimation and collective narcissism were also found.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2018-12-01|title=We Made History: Citizens of 35 Countries Overestimate Their Nation's Role in World History|journal=Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition|volume=7|issue=4|pages=521–528|doi=10.1016/j.jarmac.2018.05.006|issn=2211-3681|last1=Zaromb|first1=Franklin M.|last2=Liu|first2=James H.|last3=Páez|first3=Dario|last4=Hanke|first4=Katja|last5=Putnam|first5=Adam L.|last6=Roediger|first6=Henry L.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-power-of-collective-memory/|title=The Power of Collective Memory|last=DeSoto|first=Henry L

Consequently, collective memory represents past events as associated with the values, narratives and biases specific to that group.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wertsch|first=James V.|last2=Roediger|first2=Henry L.|date=April 2008|title=Collective memory: conceptual foundations and theoretical approaches|journal=Memory (Hove, England)|volume=16|issue=3|pages=318–326|doi=10.1080/09658210701801434|issn=0965-8211|pmid=18324555}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

Young has introduced the notion of 'collected memory' (opposed to collective memory), marking memory's inherently fragmented, collected and individual character, while Jan Assmann<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Assmann|first=Jan|date=2008|editor-last=A

===Social representations of history ===
Research on collective memory have taken the approach to compare how different social groups form their own representations of history and how such collective memories can impact ideals, values, behaviors and vice versa
