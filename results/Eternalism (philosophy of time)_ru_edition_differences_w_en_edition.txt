Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

Eternalism (philosophy of time)

ru edition's differences with the en version: 


1. 
But if eternism is true, then death is only one of our moral boundaries, and we should worry about death no more than our birth. 

2. 
Over time, the moment that was real becomes part of the past, and part of the future, in turn, becomes the new present.

4. 
The phenomenological interpretation of eternism is that "I" (as a subject) constantly "discover myself" at different times at different ages. 

5. 

The simultaneous
It is shown that the concept of sativity is not universal: observers in different countdown systems may perceive the sequence of events differently, which in the past and which in the future, it is impossible to clearly define the moment of universal time that would be "real" (but such events in any reference system occur in the same way). 

6. 

One of the areas of eternism is denied by "Freedom of Will." It is believed that future events are just as static, immutable as past events (see. 

7. 
"Eternalism" is a "Philosophy" approach to the nature of the "Philosophy of Space-Time." This approach is based on the method adopted in Physics to describe time as one of the four "Size of Space". 

8. 
A universe in which random changes are possible may be considered indistinguishable from the "Multiverse" of Everett, Hugh Everett, the multi-world interpretation of the multi-world interpretation, that is, a universe where there are many "block-universes" or "block-times."

The obvious difference between the past, present and the future
From a common sense point of view, we distinguish between the past, present and future in many events:

We are usually afraid of death because we believe that we will not exist after death.
