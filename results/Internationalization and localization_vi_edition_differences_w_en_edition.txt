How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

Internationalization and localization

vi edition's differences with the en version: 


1. 
* Translate text for printed documents, digital media (can translate with error messages and documents). 

2. 
Modern systems use Unicode standards to represent a single character in many different languages with a single coding approach. 

3. 

The localization should also consider differences in the local culture, for example:
* Holidays
* Name of person
* How to name the title
* Aesthetics
* Comprehensive and cultural relevance of the icon's image and color.

In the context of trade, the benefit of localization is to reach more markets.

Some companies like [[IBM]] and [[Sun Microsystems | Sun Microsystem]] uses the term "globalization (Globalization)", abbreviated as ' ' g11n ' ' as an alternative to both international and local chemistry. 

10. 
<ref> {{caption web | url = http://www.ibm.com/software/globalization/| title = IBM Globalization | date = Mar 17, 2016}} </ref> It is also when people use the term "' Glocalization ' '" (A ' globalization '-' ' internationalization ' and ' ' ' localized-localization ').

* Write from left to right in most European languages, from right to left in Hebrew and Arabic, or both in the type [[[[[Boustrophedon]] and written vertically in some Asian languages.

* Conventional writing for the following components:
* * Alphanumeric writing (especially [[decimal]], and how to group digits)
* * Write Date time, and add local calendar systems

[[Computer software]] may encounter the differences above and also encounter other difficulties if translating complex words and phrases, because computer programs can create dynamic content.

When translating existing text into other languages, it is difficult to maintain the parallel versions of the text over the lifetime of the product.

= = = Country convention = = =
Various countries have different industrial conventions, including:
* [[Size]]
* [TV] and data storage
* Format [[phone number]]
* [[Address | address format]], [[postal Code]], delivery service
* [[Currency | Currency system]] ([[Currency symbol | icon]], the position of the currency symbol when recording the price)-in this case people use the code [[ISO 4217]]
* [Measurement system]]
* Battery Size
* Current and voltage standards
[[Time zone]] varies across the world and this must be counted if an original product only interacts with people in a time zone and then extends the market internationally.

(Based on the chart from LISA's website)]]
By non-border software definitions, aspects should be considered when an international product is "encrypting data, documentation, software construction, hardware device support, user interaction". 

17. 

Different countries have different legal frameworks, and localization of the software is subject to those legal frameworks. 

18. 
= = Technical = =
The re-design of a software already existing or designed a new software, the first step of the international is to break down each part dependent on the language (whether the code, text or data) into each module separately and independently handle those modules.
