An '''artifact''',{{efn|From [[Latin]] phrase ''arte factum''~''ars'' ''facere'' to make}} or '''artefact''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#Miscellaneous spelling differences|American and British English spelling differences]]), is something made or given shape by humans, such as a tool or a work of art, especially an object of archaeological interest.<ref>{{cite web|title=artefact.

It is possible to authenticate artifacts by examining the general characteristics attributed to man-made tools and local characteristics of the site.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Peacock|first1=Evan|title=Distinguishing between Artifacts and Geofacts: A Test Case from Eastern England|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology|date=January 1, 1991|volume=18|issue=3|pages=345–361|doi=10.1179/009346991791548645}}</ref>

* [[Votive offering]]s
* [[Hoard]]s, such as at [[aquifer|wells]]

Artifacts are distinguished from the main body of the archaeological record such as [[Stratification (archaeology)|stratigraphic]] [[feature (archaeology)|features]], which are non-portable remains of human activity, such as [[hearth]]s, [[road]]s, deposits, trenches or similar remains, and from [[Biofact (archaeology)|biofacts]] or ecofacts, which are objects of archaeological interest made by other organisms, such as [[seed]]s or [[animal]] [[bone]].
