The Classical accounts of India: Being a compilation of the English translations of the accounts left by Herodotus, Megasthenes, Arrian, Strabo, Quintus, Diodorus, Siculus, Justin, Plutarch, Frontinus, Nearchus, Apollonius, Pliny, Ptolemy, Aelian, and others with maps. 

4. 
In Homer's case, "who set these two at each other's throats?" In Herodotus's case, "Why did the Greeks and barbarians go to war with each other?"

Herodotus's means of explanation does not necessarily posit a simple cause; rather, his explanations cover a host of potential causes and emotions. 

5. 
It was the will of the gods that the house collapsed while a particular individual was within it, whereas it was the cause of man that the house had a weak structure and was prone to falling.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=71}}</ref>

Some authors, including [[Geoffrey de Ste-Croix]] and [[Mabel Lang]], have argued that Fate, or the belief that "this is how it had to be," is Herodotus's ultimate understanding of causality.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=72–73}}</ref> Herodotus's explanation that an event "was going to happen" maps well on to Aristotelean and Homeric means of expression. 

6. 
Many of these scholars (Welsby, Heeren, Aubin, Diop, etc.) explicitly mention the reliability of Herodotus's work{{efn|such as on the [[Nile Valley]]}} and demonstrate corroboration of Herodotus's writings by modern scholars.{{efn|Welsby said that "archaeology graphically confirms Herodotus's observations."}}<ref>{{harvp|Welsby|1996|p=40}}</ref> A.H.L. 

7. 
The debt may have been repaid by Sophocles because there appear to be echoes of ''The Histories'' in his plays, especially a passage in ''[[Antigone (Sophocles play)|Antigone]]'' that resembles Herodotus's account of the death of Intaphernes (''Histories''&nbsp;3.119 ~ ''Antigone''&nbsp;904–920).<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|pp=427, 432}}</ref> However, this point is one of the most contentious issues in modern scholarship.<ref>Richard Jebb (ed), ''Antigone'', Cambridge University Press, 1976, pp.&nbsp;181–182, n. 

8. 
The archaeological study of the now-submerged [[ancient Egypt]]ian city of [[Heracleion]] and the recovery of the so-called "Naucratis stela" give credibility to Herodotus's previously unsupported claim that Heracleion was founded during the Egyptian [[New Kingdom]]. 

9. 
[[File:Himalayan Marmot at Tshophu Lake Bhutan 091007 a.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Himalayan marmot]]]] Peissel offers the theory that Herodotus may have confused the old Persian word for "marmot" with the word for "mountain ant". 

10. 
His familiarity with Athenian tragedy is demonstrated in a number of passages echoing [[Aeschylus]]'s ''[[Persae]]'', including the epigrammatic observation that the defeat of the Persian navy at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] caused the defeat of the land army (''Histories''&nbsp;8.68 ~ ''Persae''&nbsp;728). 

11. 
As a result, his reports about Greek events are often coloured by Athenian bias against rival states – [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and Corinth in particular.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|pp=8, 9, 32–34}}</ref>

''The Histories'' were sometimes criticized in antiquity,{{efn|For example, they were criticized for inaccuracy by [[Lucian]] of Samosata, who attacked Herodotus as a liar in ''Verae Historiae'' and went as far as to deny him a place among the famous on the [[Fortunate Isles|Island of the Blessed]]}} but modern historians and philosophers take a more positive view of Herodotus's methodology, especially those searching for a paradigm of objective historical writing.

These giant ants, according to Herodotus, would often unearth the gold dust when digging their mounds and tunnels, and the people living in this province would then collect the precious dust.

[[Homer]] was another inspirational source.{{efn|“In the scheme and plan of his work, in the arrangement and order of its parts, in the tone and character of the thoughts, in ten thousand little expressions and words, the Homeric student appears.”<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|p=6}}</ref>}} Just as Homer drew extensively on a tradition of oral poetry, sung by wandering minstrels, so Herodotus appears to have drawn on an Ionian tradition of story-telling, collecting and interpreting the oral histories he chanced upon in his travels. 

16. 
He lays this out in the proem: "This is the publication of the research of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, so that the actions of people shall not fade with time, so that the great and admirable achievements of both Greeks and barbarians shall not go unrenowned, and, among other things, ''to set forth the reasons why they waged war on each other''."<ref>{{harvp|Blanco|2013|p=5}}</ref>

This mode of explanation traces itself all the way back to Homer,<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=64}}</ref> who opened the ''Iliad'' by asking:

:''Which of the immortals set these two at each other's throats?''
:''Apollo,''
:''Zeus’ son and Leto’s, offended''
:''by the warlord.

Due to recent discoveries of inscriptions at Halicarnassus dated to about Herodotus's time, we now know that the Ionic dialect was used in Halicarnassus in some official documents, so there is no need to assume (like the ''Suda'') that he must have learned the dialect elsewhere.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=11}}</ref> Further, the ''Suda'' is the only source which we have for the role played by Herodotus as the heroic liberator of his birthplace.

After journeys to India and Pakistan, French ethnologist [[Michel Peissel]] claimed to have discovered an animal species that may illuminate one of the most bizarre passages in Herodotus's ''Histories''.<ref name="Peissel Ants">{{harvp|Peissel|1984}}</ref> In Book 3, passages 102 to 105, Herodotus reports that a species of fox-sized, furry "[[ant]]s" lives in one of the far eastern, Indian provinces of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]].

His record of the achievements of others was an achievement in itself, though the extent of it has been debated.

Peissel reports that, in an isolated region of northern Pakistan on the [[Deosai National Park|Deosai Plateau]] in [[Gilgit–Baltistan]] province, there is a species of [[marmot]] – the [[Himalayan marmot]], a type of burrowing [[squirrel]] – that may have been what Herodotus called giant ants.

[[Aristotle]] refers to a version of ''The Histories'' written by "Herodotus of Thurium", and some passages in the ''Histories'' have been interpreted as proof that he wrote about southern Italy from personal experience there (IV,&nbsp;15,99; VI,&nbsp;127).

Thus to understand what Herodotus is doing in the ''Histories'', we must not impose strict demarcations between the man as mythologist and the man as historian, or between the work as myth and the work as history.

His ''Histories'' primarily deals with the lives of [[Croesus]], [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], [[Cambyses II|Cambyses]], [[Bardiya|Smerdis]], [[Darius I|Darius]], and [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] and the battles of [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]], [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]], [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]], [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]], and [[Battle of Mycale|Mycale]]; however, his many cultural, [[Ethnography|ethnographical]], geographical, [[Historiography|historiographical]], and other digressions form a defining and essential part of the ''Histories'' and contain a wealth of information.

For example, he reports that the annual flooding of the [[Nile]] was said to be the result of melting snows far to the south, and he comments that he cannot understand how there can be snow in Africa, the hottest part of the known world, offering an elaborate explanation based on the way that desert winds affect the passage of the Sun over this part of the world (2:18ff).

However, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a literary critic of [[Principate|Augustan Rome]], listed seven predecessors of Herodotus, describing their works as simple, unadorned accounts of their own and other cities and people, Greek or foreign, including popular legends, sometimes melodramatic and naïve, often charming – all traits that can be found in the work of Herodotus himself.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=23}}, citing Dionysius ''On Thucydides''</ref>

Modern historians regard the chronology as uncertain, but according to the ancient account, these predecessors included [[Dionysius of Miletus]], [[Charon of Lampsacus]], [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]], [[Xanthus of Lydia]] and, the best attested of them all, [[Hecataeus of Miletus]]. 

52. 
Thus, according to Gould, Herodotus's means of explanation is a mode of story-telling and narration that has been passed down from generations prior:<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=76–78}}</ref>

{{blockquote|Herodotus' sense of what was 'going to happen' is not the language of one who holds a theory of historical necessity, who sees the whole of human experience as constrained by inevitability and without room for human choice or human responsibility, diminished and belittled by forces too large for comprehension or resistance; it is rather the traditional language of a teller of tales whose tale is structured by his awareness of the shape it must have and who presents human experience on the model of the narrative patterns that are built into his stories; the narrative impulse itself, the impulse towards 'closure' and the sense of an ending, is retrojected to become 'explanation'.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|pp=77–78}}</ref>}}

==Herodotus and myth==
Although Herodotus considered his "inquiries" a serious pursuit of knowledge, he was not above relating entertaining tales derived from the collective body of myth, but he did so judiciously with regard for his [[historical method]], by corroborating the stories through enquiry and testing their probability.<ref>{{harvp|Wardman|1960}}</ref> While the gods never make personal appearances in his account of human events, Herodotus states emphatically that "many things prove to me that the gods take part in the affairs of man" (IX, 100). 

53. 
It was, therefore, an outward-looking, international-minded port within the [[Persian Empire]], and the historian's family could well have had contacts in other countries under Persian rule, facilitating his travels and his researches. 

54. 
Research suggests that Herodotus probably did not know any Persian (or any other language except his native Greek) and was forced to rely on many local translators when travelling in the vast multilingual Persian Empire. 

55. 
Herodotus did not claim to have personally seen the creatures which he described.<ref name="Peissel Ants" /><ref>{{cite news |first=Marlise |last=Simons |author-link=Marlise Simons |date=25 November 1996 |title=Himalayas offer clue to legend of gold-digging 'ants' |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/25/world/himalayas-offer-clue-to-legend-of-gold-digging-ants.html |access-date=23 February 2016 |page=5 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref> Herodotus did, though, follow up in passage 105 of Book 3 with the claim that the "ants" are said to chase and devour full-grown camels. 

56. 
These oral histories often contained folk-tale motifs and demonstrated a moral, yet they also contained substantial facts relating to geography, anthropology, and history, all compiled by Herodotus in an entertaining style and format.<ref>{{harvp|Murray|1986|pp=190–191}}</ref>

However, a recent discovery of a [[baris (ship)|baris]] 
[described in ''The Histories''] during an excavation of the sunken Egyptian port city of Thonis-Heracleiond lends credence to Herodotus's travels and storytelling.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/wreck-unusual-ship-described-herodotus-recovered-nile-delta-180971762/|title=Wreck of Unusual Ship Described by Herodotus Recovered From Nile Delta|first=Meilan|last=Solly|website=Smithsonian}}</ref>

Herodotus provides much information about the nature of the world and the status of science during his lifetime, often engaging in private speculation. 

59. 
In fact, one modern scholar<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859}}</ref> has wondered if Herodotus left his home in Greek [[Anatolia]], migrating westwards to Athens and beyond, because his own countrymen had ridiculed his work, a circumstance possibly hinted at in an epitaph said to have been dedicated to Herodotus at one of his three supposed resting places, [[Thuria, Messenia|Thuria]]:

lies; in Ionic history without peer; <br>
a Dorian born, who fled from slander's brand <br>
and made in Thuria his new native land.<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=13}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}

Yet it was in Athens where his most formidable contemporary critics could be found.

Modern scholars generally turn to Herodotus's own writing for reliable information about his life,<ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|p=7}}</ref> supplemented with ancient yet much later sources, such as the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] ''[[Suda]]'', an 11th-century encyclopedia which possibly took its information from traditional accounts.

Herodotus is variously considered "father of comparative anthropology",<ref name="BurnHerodotus" /> "the father of ethnography",<ref name="Jones"/> and "more modern than any other ancient historian in his approach to the ideal of total history".<ref name="OswynMurray_b"/>

=== Use of sources and sense of authority ===
It is clear from the beginning of Book 1 of the ''Histories'' that Herodotus utilizes (or at least claims to utilize) various sources in his narrative.

Herodotus mentions Hecataeus in his ''Histories'', on one occasion mocking him for his naive genealogy and, on another occasion, quoting Athenian complaints against his handling of their national history.<ref>{{Herodotus|en|2|143|ref}}, {{Herodotus|en|6|137}}</ref> It is possible that Herodotus borrowed much material from Hecataeus, as stated by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in a quote recorded by [[Eusebius]].<ref>''Preparation of the Gospel'',&nbsp;X, 3</ref> In particular, it is possible that he copied descriptions of the [[crocodile]], [[hippopotamus]], and [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] from Hecataeus's ''Circumnavigation of the Known World'' (''Periegesis'' / ''Periodos ges''), even misrepresenting the source as "Heliopolitans" (''Histories''&nbsp;2.73).<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|pp=430, 440}}</ref>

But Hecataeus did not record events that had occurred in living memory, unlike Herodotus, nor did he include the oral traditions of Greek history within the larger framework of oriental history.<ref>{{harvp|Immerwahr|1985|p=431}}</ref> There is no proof that Herodotus derived the ambitious scope of his own work, with its grand theme of civilizations in conflict, from any predecessor, despite much scholarly speculation about this in modern times.<ref name="OswynMurray" /><ref>{{harvp|Burn|1972|pp=22–23}}</ref> Herodotus claims to be better informed than his predecessors by relying on empirical observation to correct their excessive schematism.

==Place in history==
Herodotus announced the purpose and scope of his work at the beginning of his ''Histories:''{{efn|For the past several hundred years, the title of Herodotus's work has been translated rather roughly as ''The Histories'' or ''The History''.

Similarly, the Athenian historian [[Thucydides]] dismissed Herodotus as a "logos-writer" (story-teller).<ref name="OswynMurray_a">{{harvp|Murray|1986|p=191}}</ref> Thucydides, who had been trained in rhetoric, became the model for subsequent prose-writers as an author who seeks to appear firmly in control of his material, whereas with his frequent digressions Herodotus appeared to minimize (or possibly disguise) his authorial control.<ref>Waterfield, Robin (trans.) and Dewald, Carolyn (ed.). 

70. 
Herodotus observed prophetically to the boy's father, "Your son's soul yearns for knowledge."

Eventually, Thucydides and Herodotus became close enough for both to be interred in Thucydides' tomb in Athens.

Aubin said that Herodotus was "the author of the first important narrative history of the world".<ref>{{harvp|Aubin|2002|pp=94–96, 100–102, 118–121, 141–144, 328, 336}}</ref> Diop provides several examples (the inundations of the Nile) which, he argues, support his view that Herodotus was "quite scrupulous, objective, scientific for his time." Diop argues that Herodotus "always distinguishes carefully between what he has seen and what he has been told."

===Accusations of bias===
Some "calumnious fictions" were written about Herodotus in a work titled ''[[On the Malice of Herodotus]]'' by [[Plutarch]], a [[Chaeronea]]n by birth, (or it might have been a [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], in this case "a great collector of slanders"), including the allegation that the historian was prejudiced against Thebes because the authorities there had denied him permission to set up a school.<ref>{{harvp|Rawlinson|1859|pp=13–14}}</ref> Similarly, in a ''Corinthian Oration'', [[Dio Chrysostom]] (or yet another pseudonymous author) accused the historian of prejudice against [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], sourcing it in personal bitterness over financial disappointments<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/37*.html |title=Dio Chrysostom ''Orat.

'''Herodotus''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ᵻ|ˈ|r|ɒ|d|ə|t|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc|Ἡρόδοτος}}, ''Hēródotos'', {{IPA-el|hɛː.ró.do.tos|att-pron}}; {{circa|484|425}} BC) was an [[Classical Greece|ancient Greek]] historian who was born in [[Halicarnassus]] in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] (modern-day [[Bodrum]], [[Turkey]]). 

80. 
For Fehling, the only credible explanation is that Herodotus invented these sources, and that the stories themselves were concocted by Herodotus himself.<ref>{{harvp|Fehling|1989|pp=4, 53–54}}</ref>}}

The accuracy of the works of Herodotus has been controversial since his own era.{{efn|Kenton L. 

81. 
In 425&nbsp;BC, which is about the time that Herodotus is thought by many scholars to have died, the Athenian comic dramatist [[Aristophanes]] created ''[[The Acharnians]]'', in which he blames the [[Peloponnesian War]] on the abduction of some prostitutes – a mocking reference to Herodotus, who reported the Persians' account of their [[The Persian Wars|wars with Greece]], beginning with the rapes of the mythical heroines [[Io (mythology)|Io]], [[Europa (Greek mythology)|Europa]], [[Medea]], and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]].<ref>Lawrence A. 

82. 
Gould argues to the contrary that this is likely because Herodotus attempts to provide the rational reasons, as understood by his contemporaries, rather than providing more abstract reasons.<ref>{{harvp|Gould|1989|p=67}}</ref>

=== Types of causality ===
Herodotus attributes cause to both divine and human agents.
