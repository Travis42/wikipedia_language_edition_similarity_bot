{{Main article|Mill's Methods}}

* [[Most Similar Systems Design]]/[[Mill's Method of Difference]]: This method consists in comparing very similar cases which only differ in the ''dependent variable'', on the assumption that this would make it easier to find those ''independent variables'' which explain the presence/absence of the dependent variable.<ref name="Anckar, Carsten 2008">Anckar, Carsten.
