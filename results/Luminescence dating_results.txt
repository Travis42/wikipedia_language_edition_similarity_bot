The complete absorbed radiation dose is determined by excitation by the light of certain minerals by the pattern (usually quartz or feldspar) and measurements emitted as a result of light

If you change the pattern in blue, green, or [[Infrared radiation | "infrared]] light, the crystal will [[Photoluminescent | luteinize]], as the energy stored in the defects will be released in the form of [[light | light]]

The intensity of luminescence varies depending on {{NP | absorbed dose | absorbed radiation dose | | Absorbed dose}} accumulated over time until pattern was in darkness

Optical dating &nbsp; is one of several methods in which age is calculated as the ratio of the total absorbed radiation dose to [[dosimetry | The power of the absorbed dose]]

Sometimes other names of the &nbsp; method are used — ' ' optically stimulated fluorescent dating ' ' (' ' FL-dating ' ') and ' ' Photoluminescent dating ' (

The typical range of the age &nbsp; is from several hundred to &nbsp; 000 &nbsp; years
