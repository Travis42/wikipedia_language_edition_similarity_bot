How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

A '''manuscript''' (abbreviated '''MS''' for singular and '''MSS''' for plural) was, traditionally, any document that is written by hand — or, once practical [[typewriter]]s became available, [[typewritten]] — as opposed to being mechanically [[printing|printed]] or reproduced in some indirect or automated way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manuscript|title=Definition of MANUSCRIPT|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> More recently, the term has come to be understood to further include ''any'' written, typed, or word-processed copy of an author's work, as distinguished from its rendition as a printed version of the same.<ref>{{OED|manuscript}}</ref> Before the arrival of [[printing]], all documents and books were manuscripts.

[[Parchment]] or [[vellum]], as the best type of parchment is known, had also replaced [[papyrus]], which was not nearly so long lived and has survived to the present only in the extremely dry conditions of [[Egypt]], although it was widely used across the Roman world.

For modern parchment makers and calligraphers, and apparently often in the past, the terms parchment and vellum are used based on the different degrees of quality, preparation and thickness, and not according to which animal the skin came from, and because of this, the more neutral term "membrane" is often used by modern academics, especially where the animal has not been established by testing.<ref name="Intro" />

Because they are books, pre-modern manuscripts are best described using bibliographic rather than archival standards.
