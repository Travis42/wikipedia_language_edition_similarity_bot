How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

Leap year

vi edition's differences with the en version: 


1. 
The rise of about 0.0076 days in relation to [[the five Lines of glands | Year of spring feces]] means that the day of spring feces will shift up earlier in the calendar every 130 years. 

2. 
* One year of spring feces (calculated between two adjacent spring points) is about 365.242375 days. 

3. 
In the split years for 4, except for the year divided by 100 which when divided by 900 did not leave the balance in 200 or 600. 

4. 
Under this principle, the average of one year has 365 + 1/4 âˆ’ 1/100 + 1/400 = 365.2425 days, ie 365 on 5 hours 49 minutes and 12 seconds. 

5. 
In accordance with [[methane cycle]], it was added seven (7) times during the nineteen cycle (19) years, usually in the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th cycles of the cycle. 

6. 

The reason behind this rule is as follows:
* The Gregorian calendar was created to ensure that the days of spring feces in Europe fell on the date [21 Mar]], to ensure that the day of [[Easter]] could be adjusted by the date of the spring more clearly. 

7. 
In the Hebrew calendar month out called ' ' Adar Rishon ' ' ([[Adar 1 | Adar firstly]]) and was added before May ' ' [[Adar]] ' ', which this month later became the month Adar Sheni ([[Adar 2 | Second Adar]). 

8. 

However, the delicate thing of history is in the process of being eliminated: [The European Union]] announced that, from the year [[2000]], the day [[29 Feb]] would be a leap day rather than 24 Feb {{need citation}}, and [[Roman Catholic Church]] now also used Feb. 

9. 
The 33-year period is not entirely complete; For every 33 years the cycle will be separated by a cycle of 29 or 37 years. 

10. 

In the case of negative calendars such as the [[Chinese calendar]], the rotation of the earth is around 29.53 days, so a lunar year is only about 354 days (rounded). 

11. 
29 days instead of 28 days. 

12. 
Other proposals suggest that the Gregorian calendar itself had the same sophisticated as that (in error) [http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mleapyr.html], [http://www.llywelyn.net/docs/misc/calendar.html].)

However, here it is not necessary to have such a schedule calculation so far because for a period of tens of thousands of years the number of days of the year may be altered because of a wide range of causes, most notably:
# [[Advanced | Wrongdoing] will shift the time of spring stool in relation to [[Orbital protractions # near the orbital point |] And so will change the length of the year spring stool. 

13. 
The dates have been countdown (including this day) until the next day is named, so the day [[24 Feb]] is ' ' Ante diem sextum calendas martii ' ' ("on Friday before the calendar of March 3"). 

14. 
The day of the original was the second day of the so-called days, but from [[the 3rd century]] It was the first day. 

15. 
[[The Roman calendar]] is derived as [[lunar] the lunar calendar]] (although from [[The 5th century]] it no longer obeyed the lunar cycle) and was named for the three-week period (phase) of the lunar cycle: The New Moon (' Calends ' ', from which the word "calendar" means calendar), the first part (' ' nones ') and Full Moon (' Ides '). 

16. 
The split years for 100 are only considered leap years if they are also divided by 400. 

17. 
The number approximates roughly with a [[linear]] average, but because the five-spring classification of the average gland is a little longer, the Julian calendar is not satisfactorily satisfactory as well as the Gregorian calendar in keeping the days of spring fall properly or observed with 21 Mar.
