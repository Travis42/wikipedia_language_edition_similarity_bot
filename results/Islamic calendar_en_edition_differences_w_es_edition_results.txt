Thus, [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and a few others begin each month at sunset on the first day that the moon sets after the sun (moonset after sunset)
4.72937e-10

Since the beginning of AH 1423 (16 March 2002), the rule has been clarified a little by requiring the geocentric conjunction of the sun and moon to occur before sunset, in addition to requiring moonset to occur after sunset at Mecca

The time for the intercalation to move from the beginning of the year to the end (twelve intercalations) is the time it takes the fixed calendar to revolve once through the seasons (about 32 1/2 tropical years)

If, on the other hand, the names relate to the intercalated rather than the fixed calendar, the second intercalation might be, for example, of a month between Muharram and Safar allowing for the first intercalation, and the third intercalation of a month between Safar and Rabi'I allowing for the two preceding intercalations, and so on
0.0356462
But, there are divergent views on whether it is licit to do so.<ref>Allal el Fassi : "Aljawab assahih wannass-hi al-khaliss ‘an nazilati fas wama yata’allaqo bimabda-i acchouhouri al-islamiyati al-arabiyah", "[...] and the beginning of Islamic Arab months", report prepared at the request of King Hassan II of Morocco, Rabat, 1965 (36 p.), with no indication of editor.</ref>

A majority of theologians oppose the use of calculations (beyond the constraint that each month must be not less than 29 nor more than 30 days) on the grounds that the latter would not conform with Muhammad's recommendation to observe the new moon of Ramadan and Shawal in order to determine the beginning of these months.<ref>Muhammad Mutawalla al-Shaârawi : Fiqh al-halal wal haram (edited by Ahmad Azzaâbi), Dar al-Qalam, Beyrouth, 2000, p

===Kuwaiti algorithm===
{{main|Tabular Islamic calendar#Kuwaiti algorithm}}
[[Microsoft]] uses the "Kuwaiti algorithm", a variant of the tabular Islamic calendar,<ref>[http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/islam/islam_tabcal.htm#kuwait The "Kuwaiti Algorithm"] (Robert van Gent).</ref> to convert Gregorian dates to the Islamic ones
0.0794724
He also says that, in terms of the fixed calendar that was not introduced until 10 AH (632 AD/CE), the first intercalation was, for example, of a month between Dhu al-Hijjah and Muharram, the second of a month between Muharram and Safar, the third of a month between Safar and Rabi'I, and so on.<ref name="Nasi"/> The intercalations were arranged so that there were seven of them every nineteen years
0.0873149

Although some scholars (see list above) claim that the holy months were shuffled about for convenience without the use of intercalation, there is no documentary record of the festivals of any of the holy months being observed in any month other than those they are now observed in
0.0891154
Since AH 1419 (1998/99), several official hilal sighting committees have been set up by the government to determine the first visual sighting of the lunar crescent at the beginning of each lunar month
0.0978122
If Nasī' meant intercalation, then the number and the position of the intercalary months between AH 1 and AH 10 are uncertain; western calendar dates commonly cited for key events in early Islam such as the Hijra, the Battle of Badr, the Battle of Uhud and the Battle of the Trench should be viewed with caution as they might be in error by one, two, three or even four lunar months
0.100823
Among these twelve months four are sacred, namely, Rajab, which stands alone, and three others which are consecutive.|Translated by Sherrard Beaumont Burnaby<ref>Sherrard Beaumont Burnaby, ''[https://archive.org/details/elementsofjewish00burnuoft Elements of the Jewish and Muhammadan calendars]'' (London: 1901) 370.</ref>}}

The three successive sacred (forbidden) months mentioned by Prophet Muhammad (months in which battles are forbidden) are [[Dhu al-Qadah|Dhu al-Qa'dah]], [[Dhu al-Hijjah]], and [[Muharram]], months 11, 12, and 1 respectively
0.100823
This Julian date (16 July) was determined by [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|medieval Muslim astronomers]] by projecting back in time their own [[tabular Islamic calendar]], which had alternating 30- and 29-day months in each lunar year plus eleven leap days every 30 years
0.101451
Still, due to the fact that both lunar reckoning systems are ultimately based on the lunar cycle itself, both systems still do roughly correspond to one another, never being more than three days out of synchronisation with one another
0.106938
However, certain sects and groups, most notably Bohras Muslims namely [[Alavi Bohras|Alavis]], [[Dawoodi Bohra|Dawoodis]] and [[Sulaymani]]s and [[Shia]] [[Ismaili]] Muslims, use a tabular Islamic calendar (see section below) in which odd-numbered months have thirty days (and also the twelfth month in a leap year) and even months have 29
0.106938

We first find the Muslim month number corresponding to the first month of the Jewish year which begins in 20874 AD/CE

Sura 9.36 states "Verily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months" and sura 37 refers to "adjusting the number of months"

Both [[al-Biruni]] and [[al-Mas'udi]] suggest that the ancient Arabs used the same month names as the Muslims, though they also record other month names used by the pre-Islamic Arabs.<ref name="EI2-Tarikh"/>

The Islamic tradition is unanimous in stating that Arabs of [[Tihamah]], [[Hejaz]], and [[Najd]] distinguished between two types of months, permitted (''ḥalāl'') and forbidden (''ḥarām'') months.<ref name="EI2-Tarikh"/> The forbidden months were four months during which fighting is forbidden, listed as Rajab and the three months around the [[hajj|pilgrimage]] season, Dhu al-Qa‘dah, Dhu al-Hijjah, and Muharram.<ref name="EI2-Tarikh"/> A similar if not identical concept to the forbidden months is also attested by [[Procopius]], where he describes an armistice that the Eastern Arabs of the Lakhmid al-Mundhir respected for two months in the [[summer solstice]] of 541 AD/CE.<ref name="EI2-Tarikh"/> However, Muslim historians do not link these months to a particular season

(He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify God [i.e., to say ''Takbîr'' ("''Allāhu-Akbar''", [i.e.] "God is the Most Great") on seeing the crescent of the months of Ramadân and Shawwâl] for having guided you so that you may be grateful to Him."}}

However, some [[Ulama|jurists]] see no contradiction between Muhammad's teachings and the use of calculations to determine the beginnings of lunar months.<ref>[http://www.islamonline.net/Arabic/contemporary/2003/10/article03.shtml Abderrahman al-Haj : "The faqih, the politician and the determination of lunar months" (in arabic)]</ref> They consider that Muhammad's recommendation was adapted to the culture of the times, and should not be confused with the acts of worship.<ref>Allal el Fassi : "Aljawab assahih..." op

The Islamic calendar, however, is based on a different set of conventions being used for the determination of the month-start-dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tabsir.net/?p=633#more-633|title=tabsir.net|publisher=}}</ref> Each month still has either 29 or 30 days, but due to the variable method of observations employed, there is usually no discernible order in the sequencing of either 29 or 30 day month lengths

The major Muslim associations of France also announced in 2012 that they would henceforth use a calendar based on astronomical calculations, taking into account the criteria of the possibility of crescent sighting in any place on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oumma.com/13434/ramadan-moubarak|last=Oumma|title=Le Conseil Français du Culte Musulman (CFCM): Ramadan moubarak!|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oummatv.tv/13306/sera-premier-jour-mois-de-ramadan|last=Nidhal Guessoum|title=Quel sera le premier jour du mois de Ramadan 2012

Therefore, the first month of the Jewish year beginning in 20874 AD/CE corresponds to the sixth month of the Muslim year AH 20874
