Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie

en edition's differences with the es version: 


1. 
Le Roy Ladurie is a leading champion of "[[microhistory]]," in which a historian uses the study of an event, locality, family or life to reveal the "structures" which underlie life in the particular period under study. 

2. 
And that because of the highly unequal nature of the French tax system, the increased taxes had to be accompanied with increased repression to crush the social resistance generated by the higher taxes. 

3. 
 During the period of the Wars of Religion, many ordinary people repulsed in equal measure by the brutal fanaticism of the Catholics and the Huguenots turned to these women, as a rejection both of the bloody mayhem caused by the Wars and of the existing social order which Christianity, whenever it be Protestant or Catholic, upheld. 

4. 
His devoutly Catholic parents had expected him to become a Catholic priest and were scandalized that their son should become an ardent Communist and atheist.<ref name=Swain98/> The Great Depression of the 1930s together with France's defeat in 1940 at the hands of Germany had caused many people in France to lose faith in both capitalism and liberal democracy. 

5. 
Some, like [[Niall Ferguson]], have questioned the value of "microhistory," arguing that it is wrong to assume that the study of one village or one incident in one town or one family reveals wider patterns of life in France, let alone the rest of Europe. 

6. 
Given this background, in which many young French people had seen at first-hand the pretty streets, avenues and squares of French cities, towns and villages sullied by acts of outrageous cruelty and violence, Le Roy Ladurie described his generation as a scarred one, saying: "It was dangerous for young people during the war. 

7. 
The first two estates, which comprised the more wealthier elements of French society were exempt from taxation and to make up the shortfall in revenue, the Third Estate was taxed more heavily than what had been the case if the tax burden in French society was spread with greater equality. 

8. 
Besides writing books, Le Roy Ladurie is a prolific essayist writing on variety of subjects such as the utility of computers as method of historical research, rates of delinquency in the French Army in the 19th century, the spread of global diseases and the belief of French peasants that magic could be used to generate impotence.<ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 199"/> The latter was a reference to the widespread practice of French peasant men in the Middle Ages and the early modern period of paying witches to use their (supposed) magical powers to make their rivals in love go impotent. 

9. 

Le Roy Ladurie has also worked on the history of French regions (''Histoire de France des régions'', 2004) and on [[anthropometric history]] as well as on the impact of climate changes on human history.

11. 
In January 1978, Le Roy Ladurie was a founding member of the ''Comité des intellectuals pour l'Europe des libertés'' (Committee of Intellectuals for a Europe of liberties), an anti-communist group of liberal French intellectuals opposed to the powerful influence of the French Communist Party on French intellectual life and the alliance of the Socialists and the Communists which they saw as a threat to French democracy.<ref>Christofferson, Michael Scott ''French Intellectuals Against the Left: The Antitotalitarian Moment of the 1970s'', Oxford: Berghahn Books, 2004 pages 268 & 275.</ref> The ''Comité des intellectuals pour l'Europe des libertés'' was not a conservative group, and instead was opposed to Communism from a liberal vantage-point, declaring itself opposed to both "the unarticulated cry and pure revolt on one hand and absolute knowledge and totalizing ideology on the other", damning the "fatal socialist-statist equation" as offering the end of the Republic and everything it stood for.<ref>Christofferson, Michael Scott ''French Intellectuals Against the Left: The Antitotalitarian Moment of the 1970s'', Oxford: Berghahn Books, 2004 page 268.</ref> In its founding manifesto, the ''Comité des intellectuals pour l'Europe des libertés'' declared its intention "to defend the synonymy of these three words: Europe, culture, freedom".<ref>Marx-Scouras, Danielle The Cultural Politics of Tel Quel: Literature and the Left in the Wake of Engagement University Park: Penn State Press, 2010 page 213.</ref> Significantly, the committee did not limit its remit to France or even Western Europe, instead proclaiming its intention to defend liberty in all of Europe, Western and Eastern. 

12. 
The ancient Celts had thrown valuable objects into pools and streams to appease the powerful water spirits that were believed to live there while, later, the Romans had imported the belief in [[Dryad]]s (woodland nymphs) and [[Naiad]]s (water nymphs).<ref name=Ladurie64-14>Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie « Naïades et dryades: Mythe de paysan français au 16ème siècle », in études françaises du 16ème siècles, numéro 9, automne 1964 pg 14.</ref> Despite becoming nominally Christian, the people of Languedoc continued to do this for centuries.<ref name=Ladurie64-14/> Peasant folklore had it that certain favored young women could be invited to join the sisterhood of the Naiads and that if they accepted the invitation by diving naked into the magical waters, they would be transformed into a sensuous Naiad who would be forever young.<ref name=Ladurie64-14/> Le Roy Ladurie suggested that these folktales about young women turning into Dryads or Naiads reflected both female fantasies of escape from the patriarchal society of 16th century Languedoc and a way for the peasants to "explain away" young women who had run away.<ref name=Ladurie64-14/>  Given the prevalence of such beliefs, many peasants took it for granted that certain women were witches who had magical powers and could talk to the spirits of the forest and the waters.

The leading role played by the French Communists in the Resistance during the German occupation and the willingness of many of the traditional French elites to support the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] together with the apparent success achieved by the Soviet regime's planned economy and its "scientific socialism" led Le Roy Ladurie, like many other people of his generation in France, to embrace Communism as the best hope for humanity.<ref name="Christofferson, Michael Scott page 30">Christofferson, Michael Scott ''French Intellectuals Against the Left: The Antitotalitarian Moment of the 1970s'', Oxford: Berghahn Books, 2004 page 30.</ref> The PCF proudly billed themselves as the "party of 75,000 shot"-a reference to the claim that the Germans had shot 75,000 French Communists between 1941-44 (the true figure was actually 10,000 French Communists executed by the Germans between 1941 and 1944); nevertheless the PCF had acquired tremendous prestige in 1940s France as a result of its role in the Resistance.<ref>Bell, David Scott & Criddle, Byron ''The French Communist Party in the Fifth Republic'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1994  page 75.</ref> The German occupation had been a profoundly traumatic experience for the French, not the least because unlike World War I, in which the ''Union sacrée'' proclaimed by [[Raymond Poincaré]] in 1914 had united the left and the right against the common German enemy, World War II had seen a civil war in France. 

15. 

Critics of Le Roy Ladurie have argued that the Holy Inquisition was an instrument of judicial repression for whom torture or the threat of torture were routine methods.<ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 198">Huges-Warrington, Marnie, ''Fifty Key Thinkers on History'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 198.</ref> The Canadian historian [[Norman Cantor]] argued that none of the people questioned by Fournier had appeared willingly before the Holy Inquisition, and that therefore the [[Fournier Register]] which Le Roy Ladurie had used as his main source for ''Montaillou'' is not reliable.<ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 198"/> Other critics have noted that the people questioned by Fournier spoke in Occitan, had their remarks written down in Latin and that Le Roy Ladurie had translated the text into French and have wondered if something has been lost in the translation.<ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 198"/>

==Resisting the "totalitarian temptation"==
In France, the ''intelligentsia'' has more prestige than does the ''intelligentsia'' in the English-speaking world and as such, intellectuals are expected to take stands on the major issues of the day. 

16. 
Many Languedoc peasants went deeply into debt in an effort to pay all of these.<ref name=HW2000-196/> The adverse climate of the 17th century, in which the [[Little Ice Age]] was at its height, together with the fact that France was constantly at war in the 17th century further contributed to the increasing misery of the peasantry of Languedoc.<ref name=Carroll99-712/> 
*In the second half of the 17th century was what Le Roy Ladurie called the fourth phase of "the long period of recession".<ref name=HW2000-196/> As the peasants struggled to pay their loans, taxes, tithes and rents, the economy of Languedoc went into a period of steep decline.<ref name=HW2000-196/> This period of rising unemployment and poverty together with poor hygiene, unsanitary living conditions, emigration to other provinces of France, late marriages and a rise in birth control – as many men started to use primitive condoms – all led to a dramatic decline in the population of Languedoc.<ref name=HW2000-196/> During this period, many wealthier families were able to embark upon land consolidation as they were able to buy the land of less successful families on the cheap.<ref name=HW2000-196/>

At the beginning of the 18th century, Languedoc society was, in Le Roy Ladurie's opinion, not far from where it had been two centuries earlier, thus making this entire period one of "''l'historie immobile''".<ref name=HW2000-196/> Le Roy Ladurie saw this as the result of the inability of the farmers of Languedoc to increase the productivity of the land, writing: <blockquote>"Some have spoken of a ''natural'' ceiling on productive resources. 

17. 
The three men who dominated French politics in the 17th century, namely the [[Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu|Cardinal Richelieu]], [[Cardinal Mazarin]] and King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] were all obsessed with winning  ''la gloire'' (the glory) of making France into the world's greatest power, which meant that the 17th century was a period of constant warfare where France was almost always at war with some other power to win ''la gloire''. 

18. 
 ''Montaillou'' was much praised by reviewers in both France and the English-speaking world for its vivid, atmospheric recreation of the everyday life of the people of Montaillou in the early 14th century.<ref>Huges-Warrington, Marnie, ''Fifty Key Thinkers on History'', London: Routledge, 2000 pages 197-198.</ref> Many critics have noted that for Le Roy Ladurie, the village priest Father [[Pierre Clergue]], an ardent womanizer whose vow of celibacy meant nothing and who apparently slept with most of the women of Montaillou seemed to be something of a hero for the historian. 

19. 
The first volume was ''L'Etat royal: de Louis XI à Henri IV, 1460-1610'' (translated into English as'' The French Royal State: 1460-1610'').<ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 199"/> In this book, Le Roy Ladurie argued that the major concerns of the French Crown were the economy, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and aristocratic politics, and that the main reasons for the growth of the French state was the need to raise revenue to pay for military expansion into [[Italy]], [[Provence]] and [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and its rivalry with [[Spain]] over mastery of western Europe.<ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 199"/>

In the second volume, ''Ancien Régime: de Louis XIII à Louis XV, 1610-1774'' (translated into English as ''The Ancien Régime''), Le Roy Ladurie argued that there was a close connection between the domestic and foreign policies of the French Crown.<ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 199"/> In particular, Le Roy Ladurie argued that periods of [[authoritarianism]] in domestic policy coincided with periods of [[aggression]] in foreign policy, and that periods of liberalism in domestic policy coincided with periods of a pacific foreign policy.<ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 199"/> In order to pay for war, the French state had to increase taxation to raise the necessary funds. 

20. 
It is like someone who is sodomised and then sodomises others."<ref name=Swain98/> Le Roy Ladurie explained that he became a Communist as a reaction to his war-time experiences.<ref name=Swain98/>

When the Hungarian writer [[Arthur Koestler]]'s 1940 novel ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' was translated into French in 1949, Le Roy Ladurie saw it as confirming the greatness of Stalinism instead of the condemnation that Koestler had intended.<ref name="Christofferson, Michael Scott page 30"/> Koestler's novel concerned a prominent Soviet Communist and Old Bolshevik named Rubashov who was arrested and charged with crimes against the Soviet Union that he did not commit, but which he willingly confessed to in a show trial after hearing an appeal to Party discipline. 

21. 

==''Carnaval de Romans''==
Another work was ''Le Carnaval de Romans: de la chandeleur au mercredi des cendres'' (translated into English as ''Carnival in Romans'') which dealt with the 1580 massacre of about twenty artisans at the annual [[carnival]] in the town of [[Romans-sur-Isère]], [[France]].<ref>Huges-Warrington, Marnie, ''Fifty Key Thinkers on History'', London: Routledge, 2000 pages 196-197.</ref> In this book, Le Roy Ladurie used the only two surviving eyewitness accounts of the massacre (one of which was hostile towards to the victims of the massacre by Guérin, the other sympathetic yet often inaccurate by Piémond), together with such information as plague lists and tax lists, to treat the massacre as a microcosm of the political, social and religious conflicts of rural society in the latter half of the 16th century in France.<ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 197"/>  This book provides an example of a [[Microhistory|micro-historical approach]] to the social structure of the town of Romans and tax rebellions in early modern France. 

22. 
Another line of criticism has centered around Le Roy Ladurie's use of the term "structures." His critics contend that he has never clearly defined the term, nor explained why "structures" change over time, or even whether the "structures" Le Roy Ladurie purports to find exist. 

23. 
Le Roy Ladurie argued that it was the devastating effect of the civil wars in France that gave birth to both anti-tax revolts as the peasants objected to the increased taxes to which the series of civil wars gave rise and a widespread belief in witchcraft, which held out the promise of a more just society.<ref name=HW2000-195/> Le Roy Ladurie wrote that witchcraft represented the lingering survival of the beliefs of the ancient pagan religion before the conversion of Languedoc  to Christianity. 

24. 

==Social history==
Other more recent treatments of [[social history]] by Le Roy Ladurie have included ''La sorcière de Jasmin'' (translated into English as ''Jasmin's Witch'') and ''Le siècle des Platter, 1499-1628'' (translated into English as ''The Beggar and the Professor: A Sixteenth Century Family Drama''). 

25. 
Le Roy Ladurie wrote in a 1949 essay about ''Darkness At Noon'' that: "Rubashov was right to sacrifice his life and especially his revolutionary honor so that the best of all possible regimes could be established one day".<ref name="Christofferson, Michael Scott page 30"/> Le Roy Ladurie was to subsequently admit that he had misunderstood the message of ''Darkness At Noon''. 

26. 
In ''Jasmin's Witch'', Le Roy Ladurie following the lead of [[Carlo Ginzburg]], who argued that the idea of witchcraft as held by peasants was very different from the idea of witchcraft held by judges and churchmen.<ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 198"/> To understand the "total social fact of witchcraft," Le Roy Ladurie used the 1842 poem ''Françouneto'' written by Jacques Boè and based on a traditional French peasant folk tale.<ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 198"/> Le Roy Ladurie contended that the poem contains many authentic traces of popular beliefs about witchcraft in rural France during the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 198"/> Le Roy Ladurie argued that the "crime" of the "witch" Françouneto was the violation of the unwritten social code of "limited wealth," namely that she increased her own wealth at the expense of others.<ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 198"/> In ''The Beggar and the Professor'', Le Roy Ladurie used the letters and memoirs of the Platter family to examine the social values of the 16th century, especially in regards to religion, medicine, crime, learning, and taxes.<ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 198"/> Another work of social history by Le Roy Ladurie was his 1982 book ''Love, Death, and Money in the Pay d'Oc, The French Peasantry: 1450-1660'', which as it title indicates examined the views held by French peasants about love, death and money.<ref name="Huges-Warrington, Marnie page 199">Huges-Warrington, Marnie, ''Fifty Key Thinkers on History'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 199.</ref>

==Political history==
Though best known for his work in "[[microhistory]]", Le Roy Ladurie has also examined the [[political history]] of France between 1460 and 1774 in a two-volume history. 

27. 

==''Les paysans de Languedoc''==
Le Roy Ladurie first attracted attention with his doctoral thesis, ''Les paysans de Languedoc'', which was published as a book in 1966 and translated into English as ''The Peasants of Languedoc'' in 1974.<ref name=HW2000-195>Huges-Warrington, Marnie, ''Fifty Key Thinkers on History'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 195.</ref> In this study of the peasantry of Languedoc over several centuries, Le Roy Ladurie employed a huge range of quantitative information such as tithe records, wage books, tax receipts, rent receipts and profit records, together with the theories of such thinkers as [[Ernest Labrousse]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[David Ricardo]], [[Fernand Braudel]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Thomas Malthus]], [[François Simiand]], [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Max Weber]], to contend that the history of Languedoc was "''l'histoire immobile''."<ref name=Huges-Warrington2000-194/> He argued that the history of Languedoc was marked by waves of growth and decline that in essence changed very little over the passage of time.<ref name=Huges-Warrington2000-194/> Le Roy Ladurie acknowledged his debt to Braudel, who had argued that it was climate and geography that shaped the course of history, but felt that Braudel had gone too far in regarding these factors as causal agents in history.<ref name=Huges-Warrington2000-194/> Instead, Le Roy Ladurie felt that culture and economics were just as important as the nature of the land and the weather.<ref name=Huges-Warrington2000-194/> Influenced by the work of his mentor [[Fernand Braudel]], Le Roy Ladurie set out to write a ''histoire totale'' (total history) of Languedoc from the 15th to the 18th centuries that would integrate political, cultural, economic, social history and environmental history.<ref name=Carroll99-712/>

Le Roy Ladurie proposed that the determining feature of life in Languedoc was the culture of the people who lived there, arguing that the people of Languedoc could not break the cycles of advance and decline not so much because of technological factors, but because of the culture that prevented them from developing more progressive technology and farming practices.<ref name=Huges-Warrington2000-194/> In ''Les paysans de Languedoc'', Le Roy Ladurie went against the prevailing Marxist view that dominated French historiography at the time that the history of early modern France from the 15th century to the 18th century was the ever-accelerating accumulation of property and wealthy by capitalists.<ref name=HW2000-195/> Instead, Le Roy Ladurie contended that in Languedoc there had been cycles of economic advance and decline from the 15th to the 18th centuries.<ref name=HW2000-195/> According to Le Roy Ladurie, there were several cycles, namely: 
*"the low water mark" in the 15th century when French society was still recovering from the massive death toll caused by the [[Black Death]] of the 14th century which had wiped out most of the population of France.<ref name=HW2000-195/> As a consequence, there was social pressure on the survivors to have as many children as possible to repopulate France.<ref name=HW2000-195/> With a growing population in the late 14th and 15th centuries, forests were cut down to make room for farms, while poorer land that had been neglected was reclaimed for the growing number of Languedoc peasants.<ref name=HW2000-195/> The growing also meant that property was constantly being subdivided while wages declined.<ref name=HW2000-195/> 
*The first phase in turn led to the second phase, the "advance" of growing prosperity that lasted until 1530.<ref name=HW2000-195/> After 1530, Le Roy Ladurie maintained that the "stubborn inelasticity" of farming practices in Languedoc combined with a growing population led to a period of economic decline that lasted for the rest of the 16th century.<ref name=HW2000-195/> Peasants planted more grain, but owing to a combination of cultural conservatism, a shortage of capital and a refusal to innovate, could not increase the productivity of the land to match the increasing population.<ref name=HW2000-195/> The growing numbers of mouths to feed together with the "stubborn inelasticity" of Languedoc farming methods led a period of social misery with more and more struggling to survive on less and less.<ref name=HW2000-195/> Many peasants moved to other provinces in a search of a better life while those that remained in Languedoc tended to get married at a later age in order to limit family size.<ref name=HW2000-195/> In the 16th century, ordinary people in Languedoc  were all too aware that they were living in very tough times, but Le Roy Ladurie wrote that they were "preoccupied to the point of self-immolation" with religious issues.<ref name=HW2000-195/> The Reformation had badly divided ordinary people, and during the [[French Wars of Religion]], Protestants and Catholics fought one another over the social domination of Languedoc society.<ref name=HW2000-195/> Between 1562 and 1598, a series of civil wars took place in France between Catholics and Huguenots to determine whether France would be a Catholic or Calvinist nation: Frenchmen went about killing each other with much passion and fury, both sides being convinced that their faith was the one true faith and that France's salvation was literally in the balance. 

28. 
Le Roy Ladurie wrote that the appeal of witchcraft with its glorification of the sensuous pleasures of the human body held out the promise of a "social inversion", which it failed to deliver upon.<ref name=HW2000-195/> In studying the cultural and religious history of Languedoc, Le Roy Ladurie was very different from many other ''Annales'' historians who usually ignored these aspects of history.<ref name=Carroll99-712/> Le Roy Ladurie wrote that by the end of the 16th century, the "Malthusian curse" had fallen on Languedoc as the substantial population growth was not matched by increased productivity of the land to provide enough food for the all the extra mouths.<ref name=HW2000-195/> 
*Starting in 1600, a third phase that Le Roy Ladurie called "maturity" began.<ref name=HW2000-195/> In the 17th century, the productivity of the land in Languedoc finally caught up with the growth in the population.<ref name=HW2000-195/> Contrary to the claims of Marxist historians, Le Roy Ladurie argued that there was little accumulation of wealth, as continuing agrarian conservatism and a major increase in what Le Roy Ladurie called "parasitic phenomena" both retarded efforts to build up capital.<ref name=HW2000-196>Huges-Warrington, Marnie, ''Fifty Key Thinkers on History'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 196.</ref> The "parasitic phenomena" were the increasing taxes levied by the French Crown combined with increased tithes demanded by the Catholic Church and increased rents by landlords. 

29. 
There was a contrast between my own career and the feelings in my family."<ref name=Swain98/> Because his father had been a minister in the Vichy government, his son grew up in an atmosphere of family shame and disgrace.<ref name=Swain98/> The historian was educated in [[Caen]] at the Collège Saint-Joseph, in [[Paris]] at the [[Lycée Henri-IV]] and in [[Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine|Sceaux]] at the [[Lycée Lakanal]].<ref name=Huges-Warrington2000-194/> He was awarded an ''[[agrégation]]'' in history after studying at the École Normale Supérieure and a ''doctorat ès lettres'' from the [[University of Paris]].<ref name=Huges-Warrington2000-194/> Le Roy Ladurie has taught at the Lycée de Montpellier, the [[University of Montpellier]], the [[École Pratique des Haute Études]] in Paris, the University of Paris and at the [[Collège de France]], where he occupied from 1973 to 1999 the chair of History of Modern Civilization and became emeritus professor.<ref name=Huges-Warrington2000-194/>

Le Roy Ladurie was a member of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) between 1945 and 1956. 

30. 
At the height of the Cold War in the early 1950s, Le Roy Ladurie described the atmosphere inside the Party as "''une intensité liturgique''".<ref name="Hazareesingh, Sudhir page 139">Hazareesingh, Sudhir ''Intellectuals and the French Communist Party: Disillusion and Decline'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991 page 139.</ref>

In 1955, Le Roy Ladurie married Madeleine Pupponi with whom he had one son and one daughter.<ref name=Carroll99-712>Carroll, Stuart "Le Roy Ladurie, Emmanuel" pages 711-712 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', Volume 1, edited by Kelly Boyd, London: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1999 page 712.</ref> Le Roy Ladurie left the PCF after doubts caused by the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]] became too much for him. 

31. 
Le Roy Ladurie described his childhood in Normandy growing up on his family estate in the countryside as intensely Catholic and royalist in politics.<ref name=Swain98>{{cite magazine

The Le Roy Ladurie family were originally the aristocratic de Roy Laduries, descended from a Catholic priest who fell in love with one of his parishioners, dropped out of the priesthood to marry her and was then ennobled by the Crown; the family dropped the aristocratic ''de'' from their surname at the time of the French Revolution.<ref name=Swain98/> Le Roy Ladurie's grandfather was a French Army officer of Catholic royalist views who was dishonorably discharged from the Army in 1902 for refusing orders from the anti-clerical government to close Catholic schools.<ref name=Swain98/> Later, the former Captain Le Roy Ladurie returned to rural Normandy, was elected mayor of Villeray and was active in organising a union for rural workers.<ref name=Swain98/>

During his childhood, Le Roy Ladurie's hero was Marshal Pétain.<ref name=Swain98/> Marshal Pétain's fall from grace – from the hero of Verdun and one of France's most loved men to the reviled collaborator and one of France's most hated men, sentenced to death for high treason for his collaboration with Germany – had a major influence on Le Roy Ladurie's sense of history.
