How to read this document: Passages from one language's article appear in order of their likelihood of containing different content from the other language. The further down you read, the more likely that the content between languages is similar. If the list is short, it is likely that the content between languages is highly similar, or that the original language article for this subject is not very long. Passages may be from any part of an article.  Sometimes they are captions for pictures, sometimes references, and sometimes they are part of the article itself. Not every passage will be meaningful.  This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

It displays the mean time, sidereal, (or star), time and the motions of the sun, moon and the five then-known planets [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Saturn]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], and [[Jupiter]].

===Middle Ages and Renaissance===
The first modern documented astrarium clock was completed in 1364 by [[Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio|Giovanni de' Dondi]] (1318–1388), a scholar and physician of the [[Middle Ages]] interested in astronomy and [[horology]]. 

7. 
The original clock, consisting of 107 wheels and [[pinion]]s, has been lost, perhaps during the sacking of Mantua in 1630, but de' Dondi left detailed descriptions which have survived, enabling a reconstruction of the clock.

9. 
De' Dondi was inspired by his father [[Jacopo Dondi dell'Orologio|Jacopo]] who designed the [[astronomical clock]] in the Piazzi dei Signori, [[Padua]], in 1344 – one of the first of its type.

This mechanism, known as the [[Antikythera mechanism]], was recently redated to end of the 2nd century BCE.<ref>{{cite web |title=Antikythera Mechanism Research Project |url=http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/ |website=www.antikythera-mechanism.gr |language=en |access-date=2008-03-17 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ay917M8F?url=http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/ |archive-date=2012-09-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Extensive study of the fragments, using X-rays, has revealed enough details (gears, pinions, crank) to enable researchers to build partial replicas of the original device.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solid Models of the Antikythera Mechanism {{!}} Antikythera Mechanism Research Project |url=http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/data/models/solid-models.html |website=www.antikythera-mechanism.gr |language=en |access-date=2008-03-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315145051/http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/data/models/solid-models.html |archive-date=2008-03-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sfr.ee.teiath.gr/historia/historia/graphics/instr/images/antik06.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206040835/http://sfr.ee.teiath.gr/historia/historia/graphics/instr/images/antik06.jpg |archivedate=2006-12-06 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/NatSci102/text/extgreek_files/image004.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216100016/http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/NatSci102/text/extgreek_files/image004.jpg |archivedate=2008-02-16 }}</ref> Engraved on the major gears are the names of the planets, which leaves little doubt as to the intended use of the mechanism.
