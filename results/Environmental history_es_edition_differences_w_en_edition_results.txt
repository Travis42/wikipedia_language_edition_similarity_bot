This discipline integrates elements of [[agrarian history], in the way that the [Annales School] used the French-oriented [[human geography]] of [Vidal de la Blache]: [[Fernand Braudel] and his famous work ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Time of Philip II'', which begins with what can be considered an ecohistory of the [[Mediterranean Basin]] under its long-term concept ''La terre et la evolution humaine'' by [[Lucien Febvre]]; or the ''French rural history'' by [[Marc Bloch]]
