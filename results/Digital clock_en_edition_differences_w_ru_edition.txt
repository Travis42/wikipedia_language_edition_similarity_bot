Digital clock

en edition's differences with the ru version: 


1. 
 This is a particular problem with [[alarm clock]]s that have no "battery" backup, because a [[power outage]] during the night usually prevents the clock from triggering the alarm in the morning. 

2. 
 The incorporation of automatic synchronization by a radio time signal is reducing this problem (see [[Radio clock]]). 

3. 
By 1885 Pallweber mechanism was already on the market in pocket watches by [[Cortébert (watch manufacturer)|Cortébert]] and [[International Watch Company|IWC]]; arguably contributing to the subsequent rise and commercial success of IWC. 

4. 
While the original inventor didn't have a watch brand at the time, his name has since been resurrected by a newly established watch manufacturer.<ref name="JosefPallweber">{{cite web

'''Plato clocks''' used a similar idea but a different layout. 

5. 

To reduce the problem, many devices designed to operate on household electricity incorporate a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] backup to maintain the time during power outages and during times of disconnection from the power supply. 

6. 
Commercial digital clocks are typically more reliable than consumer clocks.

13 years earlier Josef Pallweber had patented the same invention using digital cards (different from his 1885 patent using moving disks) in Germany (DRP No.

Throughout the 1970s, despite the initial hefty cost of digital watches, the popularity of said devices steadily rose.

To represent the time, most digital clocks use a [[Seven-segment display|seven-segment]] [[LED]], [[vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]], or [[LCD]] for each of four [[Numerical digit|digits]].

Digital clocks are often associated with electronic drives, but the "digital" description refers only to the display, not to the drive mechanism. 

12. 
(Both analog and digital clocks can be driven either mechanically or electronically, but "clockwork" mechanisms with digital displays are rare.)

== History ==
The first digital pocket watch was the invention of Austrian engineer Josef Pallweber who created his "jump-hour" mechanism in 1883.
