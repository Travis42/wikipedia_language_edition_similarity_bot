The Long Count is not pure base-20, however, since the second digit from the right (and only that digit) rolls over to zero when it reaches 18.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Thus 0.0.1.0.0 does not represent 400 days, but rather only 360 days and 0.0.0.17.19 represents 359 days.

Given our modern ability to know exactly where to look, when the crescent Moon is favorably located, from an excellent site, on rare occasions, using binoculars or a telescope, observers can see and photograph the crescent moon less than one day after conjunction.

Of the six sites, three are on the western edge of the Maya homeland and three are several hundred kilometers further west, leading some researchers to believe that the Long Count calendar predates the Maya.<ref>Diehl (2004, p.

Although this system is popular among [[Mayanists]], it is rarely used by anyone else, so for example, dates converted using this system are useless for the study of [[Maya Astronomy]].</ref>

Using as an example the Long Count date of 9.10.11.17.0 (Long Count date mentioned on the Palenque Palace Tablet), first calculate the number of days that have passed since the zero date (August 11, 3114 BC; GMT correlation, in the [[Proleptic Gregorian calendar]], September 6, −3113 [[Proleptic Julian calendar|Julian]] astronomical).

==Converting between the Long Count and western calendars==

===Calculating a western calendar date from a Long Count===

'''It's important to know the difference between the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendars when doing these conversions.''' <ref group=n>In 46 BC Julius Caesar adopted the convention of having three years of twelve months of approximately 30 days each to make a year of 365 days and a leap year of 366 days. 

62. 
Instead the Maya were using an abbreviated [[Maya calendar#Short count|Short Count]]. 

63. 

So the date of the long count date 9.12.2.0.16 5 Kibʼ 14 Yaxkʼin is confirmed.

Most of these are in the form of "distance dates" where some Long Count date is given, together with a Distance Number that is to be added to the Long Count date to arrive at this future date. 

66. 
The inscription notes {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} that this day would fall eight days after the completion of the 1st ''piktun'' [since the creation or zero date of the Long Count system], where the ''piktun'' is the next-highest order above the ''bʼakʼtun'' in the Long Count. 

67. 
This made the length of the civil year 365.25 days, close to the length of the solar year of 365.2422 days. 

68. 
This date (glyphs A2, B2, ..., A5) is 10.2.9.1.9 &nbsp; 9 Muluk 7 Sak, equivalent to July 28, 878 (GMT Gregorian).]]

As stated, a full Long Count date not only includes the five digits of the Long Count, but the 2-character Tzolkʼin and the two-character Haabʼ dates as well.

==2012 and the Long Count==
{{main|2012 phenomenon}}

According to the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', a book compiling details of [[Mesoamerican creation accounts|creation accounts]] known to the [[Kʼicheʼ people|Kʼicheʼ Maya]] of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world.<ref name="schele1">Schele & Freidel (1990), pp. 

73. 
Astronomers have proposed many correlations, for example: [[Floyd Lounsbury|Lounsbury]],<ref>A Derivation of the Maya-to-Julian Calendar Correlation From the Dresden Codex Venus Chronology, in ''The Sky In Mayan Literature'' (1992)</ref> Fuls, ''et al.'',<ref name="archaeoastronomie">{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeoastronomie.de/mayaeng/corrtabl.htm |title=The Correlation Question by Andreas Fuls |publisher=archaeoastronomie.de|accessdate=2015-09-06}}</ref> Böhm and Böhm<ref name="hermetic2">{{cite web|url=http://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/maya/boehm/korelaceangl.doc |title= Mayan Dating by Vladimir Böhm and Bohumil Böhm |publisher=hermetic.ch|accessdate=2015-09-06}}</ref><ref name="volny">{{cite web|url=http://www.volny.cz/paib/ |title=Mayan dating, Mayan astronomy, Correlation MD/JD |publisher=volny.cz|accessdate=2015-09-06}}</ref> and Stock.<ref name="baktun">{{cite web|url=http://www.baktun.de/English/english.html |title= Dating the Eclipse Table of the Dresden Codex and the Correlation Problem |author=Anton Stock|publisher=baktun.de|accessdate=2015-09-06}}</ref>

Today, {{Date}} ([[UTC]]), in the Long Count is {{Maya date}} (GMT correlation). 

74.

</center>

Then add the GMT correlation to the total number of days. 

75. 
The glyphs surrounding the date are what is thought to be one of the few surviving examples of [[Epi-Olmec script]].]]

The Maya and Western calendars are correlated by using a [[Julian day number]] (JDN) of the starting date of the current creation — 13.0.0.0.0, 4 [[Ajaw]], 8 Kumkʼu.<ref group=n>All extant Maya inscriptions that represent this base date wrote it with a "13" bakʼtuns, not "0". 

76. 

Modern astronomers refer to the conjunction of the Sun and Moon (the time when the Sun and Moon have the same ecliptic longitude) as the new moon. 

77. 
The number of leap days, keeping in mind that the year 600 is not a leap year, is 10. 

78. 

:138,3136 − 17 = 1,383,119

Divide by 365

:1,383,119 / 365 = 3,789 and (134/365)

Therefore, 3,789 complete Haabʼ have passed and the remainder 134 is the 135th day in the new Haabʼ, since a remainder of 0 would indicate the first day.

===Calculating the Tzolkʼin date portion===
The Tzolkʼin date is counted forward from 4 Ajaw. 

80. 
In the Gregorian Calendar, every fourth year is a leap year with the exception of centuries not evenly divisible by 400 (e.g. 

81. 
[[astronomical year numbering|Astronomical]] dating has a year 0. 

82. 
For example, the year 3114 BCE is the year −3113 astronomical. 

83. 
This is easily confused when the "13" bakʼtuns has the actual value 13 in the ''current'' baktʼun, as in the Maya date for today: {{Maya date}} (={{CURRENTDATE}}).</ref> This is referred to as a correlation constant. 

84. 

In this Example:

 '''input:''' Julian day ''J''
 ''J'' = ''J'' + 0.5    ''// 1,956,583.5''
 ''Z'' = integer part of ''J''           ''// 1,956,583''
 ''F'' = fraction part of ''J''          ''// 0.5''
 
 '''if''' ''Z'' < 2,299,161 '''then''' ''// Julian?''
     ''A'' = ''Z''
 '''else'''
     ''alpha'' = floor((''Z'' - 1,867,216.25) / 36,524.25)   ''// 15''
     ''A'' = ''Z'' + 1 + ''alpha'' - floor(''alpha'' / 4.0)          ''// 2,436,129''
     ''// The floor operation rounds a decimal number down to the next lowest integer.''
     ''// For example, floor(1.5) = 1 and floor(−1.5) = -2''
 '''end if'''
 
 ''B'' = ''A'' + 1524                     ''// 1,958,107''
 ''C'' = floor((''B'' - 122.1) / 365.25)  ''// 5,360''
 ''D'' = floor(365.25 &times; ''C'')            ''// 1,957,740''
 ''E'' = floor((''B'' - ''D'') / 30.6001)     ''// 11''
 ''day'' = ''B'' - ''D'' - floor(30.6001 &times; ''E'') + ''F''   ''// 31.5''
 
 '''if''' ''E'' < 14 '''then'''
     ''month'' = ''E'' - 1   ''// 10''
 '''else'''
      ''month'' = ''E'' - 13
 '''end if'''
 
 '''if''' ''month'' > 2 '''then'''
     ''year'' = ''C'' - 4716    ''// 644''
 '''else'''
     ''year'' = ''C'' - 4715
 '''end if'''
 
 '''return''' (''year'', ''month'', ''day'')

In this example the ''[[Julian calendar|Julian]]'' date is noon October 31, 644.

For example, on the west panel at the [[Temple of Inscriptions]] in [[Palenque]], a section of the text projects into the future to the 80th Calendar Round (CR) 'anniversary' of the famous Palenque ruler [[Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal]]'s accession to the throne (Pakal's accession occurred on a Calendar Round date 5 Lamat 1 Mol, at Long Count 9.9.2.4.8 equivalent to 27 July 615 CE in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]]).<ref group=n>Gregorian, using GMT correlation JDN=584283.</ref> It does this by commencing with Pakal's birthdate 9.8.9.13.0{{nbsp|2}}8 Ajaw 13 Pop (24 March {{nowrap|603 CE Gregorian}}) and adding to it the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8.<ref name="Schele 1992, pp.93–95">Schele (1992, pp.

This calculation arrives at the 80th Calendar Round since his accession, a day that also has a CR date of {{nowrap|5 Lamat 1 Mol}}, but which lies over 4,000 years in the future from Pakal's time—the day 21 October in the year 4772. 

92. 

To calculate the day, divide the total number of days in the long count by 20 since there are twenty day names. 

93. 
To calculate the numerical portion of the Tzolkʼin date, add 4 to the total number of days given by the date and then divide total number of days by 13.
