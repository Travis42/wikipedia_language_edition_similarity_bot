So midnight is 0.0 days, noon is 0.5 d, etc., which can be composed with any type of date, such as:
* [[Gregorian calendar]]: 2000 January 1.5
* [[ISO 8601'ordinal dates]]: 00001.5
* [[Julian Day]]: 2451545.0
* [[Microsoft Excel' Excel]] serial dates: 36526.5

It is possible to use as many decimal places as necessary according to the required precision, so that 0.5 d x 0.500000 d

Several of the nearly 50 Chinese calendars also divided each ''ke'' into 100 ''fen'', although in others each ''ke'' was divided into 60 ''fen''

In 1280, the 'Shoushi' (Season Granting) calendar subdivided each ''fen'' into 100 ''miao'', creating a complete decimal system of 100 ''ke'', 100 ''fen'' and 100 ''miao''

The primary divisions were called hours, and added:

Indeed, this is the representation in a single unit used by numerous programming languages, including [[C- C]], and part of the UNIX/POSIX standards used by Mac OS X, [[Linux]], etc.; to convert fractional days into fractional seconds, multiply the number by 86400

Using fractional days reduces the number of units used in time calculations from four (days, hours, minutes, seconds) to a single (day)

The expression of the [[day] extent is called the expression of the [[day]] extension using units that are related by a system [[decimal numbering system]]

"Other decimal times"
Different people have proposed a range of variations to decimal time, dividing the day into different number of units and subunits with different names
