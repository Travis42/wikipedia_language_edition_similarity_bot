This is merely a guide to help you find the most novel content, quickly.

The study of the means of placing pottery and other cultural artifacts into some kind of order proceeds in two phases, classification and typology: Classification creates categories for the purposes of description, and typology seeks to identify and analyse changes that allow artifacts to be placed into sequences.<ref>{{cite book | last =Greene | first =Kevin | authorlink = | title =Archaeology : An Introduction | publisher =University of Newcastle Upon Tyne | date =November 2007 | location = | pages =Chapter 4 | url =http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/kevin.greene/wintro/chap4.htm | isbn = | accessdate =2008-01-04 | nopp =true | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20050329085720/http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/kevin.greene/wintro/chap4.htm | archive-date =2005-03-29 | url-status =dead }}</ref>

Much of modern historical datings and chronology of the ancient world ultimately derives from these two works.<ref name=Grafton>{{cite book|last1=Grafton|first1=Anthony|title=Joseph Scaliger: A Study in the History of Classical Scholarship|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}</ref> Scaliger invented the concept of the [[Julian day|Julian Day]] which is still used as the standard unified scale of time for both historians and astronomers.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In addition to the literary methods of synchronism used by traditional chronographers such as Eusebius, Syncellus and Scaliger, it is possible to synchronize events by archaeological or astronomical means. 

8. 
To place all the events on the same time scale, Eusebius used an [[Anno Mundi]] (A.M.) era, meaning that events were dated from the supposed beginning of the world as computed from the [[Book of Genesis]] in the Hebrew [[Pentateuch]].

Likewise, various eclipses and other astronomical events described in ancient records can be used to astronomically synchronize historical events.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kelley|first1=David H.|title=Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy|date=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1441976239|pages=614}}</ref> Another method to synchronize events is the use of archaeological findings, such as pottery, to do [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|sequence dating]].
