#Project Log

- I have pywikibot installed in the projects directory.  This seems to be the way to use it rather than to pip install.

- my wikiscripts dir is where I'm making my own stuff.

- working on translation api to google now.

- next is comparing japanese article with english
    - first read and translate an example article, hand pulled.
    - compare to a hand pulled English article using IFIDF.
    - see if that means anything.

## Possible Limitations
- Google Translate API might limit translations to 5000 characters.
