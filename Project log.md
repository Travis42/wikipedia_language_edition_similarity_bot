# Project Log

## Next Actions
- next is comparing japanese article with english
    - compare to a hand pulled English article using IFIDF.
    - see if that means anything, record the similarity level
    - try it with a handful of other articles, get an average similarity.































## Structure
- I have pywikibot installed in the projects directory.  This seems to be the way to use it rather than to pip install.

- my wikiscripts dir is where I'm making my own stuff.

## Limitations
- Google Translate API might limit translations to 5000 characters. (solved)
